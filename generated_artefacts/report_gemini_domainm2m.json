After packing, the parcels are weighed.  The process then splits into three parallel paths: printing shipping labels, moving parcels to the loading dock, and inspecting the packing quality. Once the shipping labels are printed,  two parallel paths begin: moving the parcels to the loading dock and checking the parcel count.  Once all three parallel paths (printing labels, moving to loading dock, and inspecting quality) are complete, they converge.  Now, the parcels are loaded on the truck and, simultaneously, delivery instructions are sent to the transporter and the order status is updated.  Finally, stock levels are updated, the delivery instructions are sent and when both tasks are complete the process ends.\n",

Next, the parcels are weighed, and shipping labels are printed for them.  At this point, three things happen simultaneously: the parcels are moved to the loading dock, the number of parcels is checked, and the quality of the packing is inspected. Once all three of these tasks are complete, the process continues.  The parcels are loaded onto the truck, and simultaneously the delivery instructions are sent to the transporter and the order status is updated.  After the order status is updated, stock levels are also updated.  Finally, once the delivery instructions have been sent and the stock levels have been updated, the process is complete.\n",

At this point, a decision is needed: did the customer respond to the offer?  If the answer is \"yes\", then the customer provides an additional request and the process moves to providing details for that request. Following this, there's another decision point: is the customer ready to book?\n\nIf the customer decides not to book at this stage, the process ends. However, if they choose to proceed with booking, a booking request is received and the travel is booked.  After booking the travel, a booking confirmation is sent to the customer and, simultaneously, the bill is sent.\n\nNow, another decision point arises: Was the payment received? If \u201cyes,\u201d then the process is complete. If \u201cno,\u201d the customer is contacted. Following the contact, the process goes back to checking for payment and this loops until the payment is received.\n\n\nIf the customer initially did not respond to the offer, the process ends.  Similarly, if after providing details for the customer's additional request, the customer chooses not to book and subsequently doesn't proceed, the process also ends. Finally, If the customer confirms their booking but doesn't provide payment after being contacted, and the loop continues to the decision \u201cWas the payment received?\u201d the process continues until payment is received. \n",

On one path, raw materials are collected, leading to the cutting stage.  After cutting is complete, the process merges with the other path.  The other path involves adjusting settings and checking if further adjustments are needed. If more adjustments are needed, the process loops back to collecting raw materials. If no further adjustments are needed, the process continues.\n\nCutting leads to parallel processes of stitching and printing.  Once both stitching and printing are finished, they converge to the completion of production. Following production completion, the product quality is checked and a quality report is created. Based on the quality report, a decision is made: either send the data to the warehouse or adjust settings and restart a portion of the process. If settings adjustments are necessary, the process loops back to gathering raw materials, effectively repeating the cutting, stitching, printing, and production steps.\n\nIf the quality report is satisfactory, data is sent to the warehouse, concluding the process.\n",

If a special carrier is selected, quotes are requested from different carriers, and a carrier is assigned before preparing the paperwork.\n\nRegardless of the shipping type chosen, the next step is checking the insurance.  If extra insurance is needed, the customer takes it out. If not, the process continues.  This insurance check happens after the post label is filled in for regular post, and after the paperwork is prepared if a special carrier is used.\n\nOnce the goods are packaged and the paperwork (including any extra insurance) is finalized, both sets of actions converge, and the paperwork is added to the package.

Upon receiving the request, two parallel processes are initiated: packaging the goods and selecting the kind of shipment.  \n\nThe shipment selection determines the next steps. If a special carrier is required, quotes are requested from those carriers. The chosen carrier is then assigned, and the paperwork is prepared.  Alternatively, if regular post is sufficient, a post label is filled in.\n\nAfter filling in the post label, the insurance is checked.  This leads to a decision regarding extra insurance. If extra insurance is desired, it is taken out. Regardless of this decision, the process converges and continues.\n\nSimultaneously, once the goods are packaged and the paperwork is prepared (following carrier assignment or post label creation), the two parallel processes converge.  The paperwork is added to the package, and finally, the package is moved to the pickup area, concluding the process.\n",

If the check reveals it's a standard request, the process proceeds to automatic registration. If it's not a standard request, it goes to manual registration.  Both automatic and manual registration converge to a single point where the relevance of the request is evaluated.\n\nIf the request is deemed not relevant, a notification is sent to the customer, and the process ends.  However, if the request is relevant, the process branches based on whether it's a standard request or not.  If standard, it proceeds directly to searching for an attraction provider. If not, it first goes through automatic or manual registration (as described earlier) and *then* searches for a provider.\n\nOnce a provider search is completed, the process checks if a provider was found. If not, the customer is notified, and the process ends.  If a provider *is* found, the process attempts to book the attraction.\n\nAfter the booking attempt, the process waits for either a booking confirmation or a rejection.  If a rejection is received, the process loops back to search for a different attraction provider.  This loop continues until either a provider is found and the booking is confirmed *or* no provider can be found.\n\nIf a booking confirmation is received, the confirmation is sent to the customer, and the process ends.\n",

Once both sets of information are gathered, two parallel processes begin: Data Loss Limitation and notifying the National Authority.  After the National Authority is notified, the stolen data is evaluated.  This evaluation leads to a decision: \"Are the stolen data exploitable?\"\n\nIf the stolen data are NOT exploitable, the security standard is evaluated. This evaluation leads to another decision:  \"Does the data controller have a high security standard?\" If YES, a request is made to determine whether the breached data has to be communicated to the data subject. After the notification for this request is received, another decision point is reached: \"The data subject has to be notified?\"  If YES, the process follows the same path as if the stolen data WERE exploitable (described below). If NO, the process ends.\n\nIf the data controller does NOT have a high security standard, or if the stolen data ARE exploitable (from the earlier decision), the process converges to a single path.  This path involves sending a notification to the data subjects, followed by a check if notification was successfully sent. Once confirmed, the process ends.\n",

Then, two parallel processes kick off:  Data loss limitation efforts begin, and simultaneously, the national authority is notified.\n\nOnce the national authority has been notified, the stolen data is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, a decision is made: Are the stolen data exploitable? If yes, a further decision point is reached about whether the affected data subjects have to be notified.  If the decision is yes, a notification is sent, and after the notification is sent, a final check occurs. This check, whose details are not explicitly modeled here, appears to finalize the process. If, at the first decision point, the stolen data were deemed *not* exploitable, the process evaluates the security standard.\n\nIn parallel with the data loss limitation activities, after the breached subjects are retrieved, a decision gateway assesses if the data controller has a high security standard. If yes, a request is made to determine whether the breached data has to be communicated to the data subject. A notification for the request is then received, and this feeds into the same decision point we reached earlier \u2013 whether the data subject has to be notified.  If the decision is again yes, the notification is sent, and the process continues to the final check.\n\nIf, however, the data controller does *not* have a high security standard, the process merges with the path followed when the stolen data were deemed exploitable, and the same decision point regarding notification of data subjects is reached again. Following that decision, notification may or may not be sent, and the process concludes with the final check. If, at the first decision, about whether stolen data are exploitable, and if the data subject has to notified the answer is no, then the final check occurs.\n",

Next, the patient visits a nurse who checks their current health state.\n\nBased on the patient's condition, the process diverges. If the patient is deemed healthy enough to go home, they are sent home, ending the process.  If further examination is needed, the process continues.\n\nIf the patient requires further examination, the hospital must then determine the patient's registration status. If the patient is not registered, they are registered.  Regardless of pre-existing registration or after completing new registration, the patient proceeds to check their insurance.\n\nAfter insurance is checked, the decision branches based on whether the patient's insurance is accepted or not. Assuming it is, the patient then books an appointment with a doctor. If the insurance isn't accepted, then the patient must pay a fee before booking an appointment with the doctor. After the appointment is booked, the patient will be examined by the doctor.\n\nFollowing the doctor's examination, the process branches again based on the doctor's assessment. Three possibilities exist: the patient needs hospitalization, medication, or is healthy enough to go home.\n\nIf the patient needs to be hospitalized, they are hospitalized, and then after discharge, they pay a fee before going home, ending the process.\n\nIf the patient needs medicine, they are sent to the pharmacy.  At the pharmacy, they order their medicine, then pay for it, and finally, they receive the medicine.  After receiving the medicine, the patient goes home, ending the process.\n\nIf the patient is healthy after the doctor\u2019s examination, they are simply sent home, ending the process.\n",

Next, the patient visits the nurse, who then checks the patient's insurance. Following this check, there is a decision point regarding the patient's insurance coverage. \n\nIf the insurance is valid, the patient proceeds to registration.  If the patient is not registered, they are registered with the hospital. Whether the patient was already registered or just newly registered, they then proceed to pay the hospital fee. After paying the fee, the patient is booked for a doctor's appointment.  This booking leads to the patient being examined by the doctor.\n\nAfter the examination, another decision point occurs based on the doctor's diagnosis.  There are three possible paths:\n\n1. If the patient is healthy, they are sent home.\n2. If the patient needs hospitalization, they are hospitalized and then, eventually, they are also sent home as they get better and leave.\n3. If the patient needs medicine, they are sent to the pharmacy.  At the pharmacy, the patient orders medicine, pays for the medicine, and receives the medicine.  Finally, the patient leaves the hospital after getting their medicine, and the process ends.\n\n\nIf the initial insurance check reveals invalid insurance, the patient's state is checked.  Following this check, there's another decision point: if the patient's condition is okay, they are sent home, and the process ends. If their condition is not okay, they are checked for registration, and the process loops back to the registration check, as described earlier.  This loop continues until either the patient's condition improves enough to be sent home directly after the state check, or their insurance issue is resolved. After any of the last steps are executed, and the patient is discharged, the entire process ends.\n",

The hospital then makes a decision about whether to accept the patient.\n\nIf the patient is accepted, she is added to the list of patients and undergoes a patient control check. If the pregnancy is less than 8 months along, the patient is added back to the patient list for further monitoring and control checks. This loop continues until the pregnancy reaches 8 months.  If the pregnancy is in or beyond the 8th month, the hospital calls the patient to come in.  After arrival, the patient is hospitalized, gives birth, and then undergoes a health check for both the patient and baby.  \n\nIf after birth the patient and baby are healthy, the patient is discharged and enters post-hospitalization care. This eventually concludes the process.  However, if the patient or baby are not healthy after birth, they receive special treatment. After the special treatment, the patient is discharged and the process ends.\n\nIf the initial decision is to not accept the patient, the process ends immediately.\n",

Following this assessment, two actions happen concurrently: a physical examination is performed, and blood samples are drawn. The blood samples are then sent to a lab for analysis. Once the lab analysis is received, it is combined with the results of the physical examination to inform the diagnosis. Based on the diagnosis, a decision is made: if surgical intervention is required, the patient undergoes surgery. If surgery is not required, a surgical plan is prepared.  Regardless of whether actual surgery or just a plan is created, the patient is subsequently discharged, marking the end of the process.\n",

The shipping process involves deciding where the delivery should take place: at the recipient's door or at a designated station.\n\nIf door delivery is chosen, the process checks if the recipient is present. If the recipient is present, the delivery is considered successful, and the process ends. If the recipient is *not* present, a pick-up receipt is printed and subsequently posted to the recipient.  After this, the package is rerouted to the closest station, and the recipient can pick it up there.  Once at the station, the process continues to the next stage.\n\nIf station delivery is chosen initially, the process skips the recipient presence check and moves directly to the next stage.\n\nThis next stage, regardless of whether the package was delivered to the door or a station, involves the recipient receiving the product.  At this point, there's a check to see if the product is damaged.\n\nIf the product is *not* damaged, the process ends successfully. If the product *is* damaged, the recipient returns the product. The process then ends, likely signifying an unsuccessful delivery or the initiation of a return/replacement process.\n",

If the recipient is present, the product is delivered and the process ends. If the recipient is not present, a pick-up receipt is printed and posted to the recipient.  After this, the package is rerouted to the nearest pick-up station. The package arrives at the station and the recipient picks it up and the process ends.\n\nIf the initial delivery location chosen was a pick-up station, the product is delivered to the station, and the recipient is notified to pick-up the product at this time. Whether the product was delivered to their door initially or rerouted to a station and picked up there, upon collecting the package the product is checked for damage. If the product is damaged, it is returned and the process ends. If the product is not damaged, the process is complete.\n",

At this point, a decision is made: are any parts missing?\n\nIf yes, the missing parts are purchased and put into stock.  Once the parts are in stock, or if no parts were missing initially, the process continues to production.\n\nAfter production is complete, quality checks are performed. The results of the quality checks determine the next step. If the production process is deemed finished (quality checks passed), the product is filled into packaging.  If the production process is not finished, follow-up production is performed, and the process loops back to perform quality checks again. This cycle continues until the production process is considered finished.\n\nOnce the product is packaged, it's then packed and labeled.  Following packing and labeling, the product is transported to the warehouse. Finally, the product is sent to the customer, concluding the process.\n",

Following the quality checks, another decision is made: Is the production process finished?\n\nIf yes, the product is filled into packaging, then packed and labeled, and finally transported to the warehouse. After transport, the product is sent to the customer, and the process ends.\n\nIf the production process is not finished, follow-up production is performed.

One path leads to Production Planning, while the other remains undefined, suggesting a potential alternative start.  If Production Planning is chosen, it is followed by Assigning Workers, then Production Design. After Production Design, the product is delivered.  Following Product Delivery, Production Logout occurs, leading into Quality Control.\n\nThe results of Quality Control determine the next step. If the quality is deemed \"bad\", the process loops back to the initial decision point, restarting a portion of the process.  If the quality is \"good\", the process proceeds to determine if the product is a \"Final product\".\n\nIf the product is deemed final, it's Registered to the Finished Stock and then Stock to Finished Goods occurs.  If not, it's Registered to the Semi-finished Stock and then Loaded to the Semi-finished Stock.  Both the \"Stock to Finished Goods\" and \"Load to the Semi-finished Stock\" steps converge at a common point.  Finally, from this convergence point the process ends.\n",

If Production Planning is chosen, it is followed by assigning workers and then Production Design.  After Production Design, the product is delivered and then there is a Production Logout.  Following the logout, Quality Control takes place.  \n\nThe Quality Control step leads to another decision: is the quality good or bad?  If the quality is bad, the process loops back to the very first decision point, potentially restarting the entire production cycle. If the quality is good, the process proceeds to the next decision point, asking: is this the final product?\n\nIf it is the final product, it is registered in the finished stock and then moved to the finished goods stock. If it is not the final product, it is registered in the semi-finished stock and then loaded into that stock.  Regardless of whether the product goes into finished or semi-finished stock, both paths converge to a final point before the process ends.\n",

Based on the estimated status, if it's \"ok,\" the process merges back to the main flow.  If it's \"not ok,\" a container change request is generated, which also merges back to the main flow.\n\nA second parallel branch starts by getting the client's location and then estimating the distance. If the distance is less than 300km, the delivery time is estimated. If the distance is 300km or greater, or if the estimated delivery time is not \"ok,\" a route change request is generated. Regardless of the distance or delivery time estimation, this branch also merges back to the main flow.\n\nThe third and final parallel branch involves getting the goods status and then estimating that status.  If damage is detected, the damage is then evaluated.  If the goods are \"ruined,\" a removal request is generated. If the goods are \"compromised,\" a price change request is generated.  If there is no damage, or after a removal or price change request is generated, this branch merges back with the others.\n\nAfter all three parallel branches complete, any generated messages (standard notifications, container change requests, route change requests, removal requests, or price change requests) are sent.

Otherwise, if the temperature falls outside this range, several parallel actions are initiated:\n\n1. **Container Information:** The container status is retrieved, and simultaneously, a container status estimate is made. The estimated status is then checked.  If it's \"ok,\" the process moves to the next parallel branch. If it's \"nok,\" a container change request is generated, which is then evaluated and merged back into the main flow.\n\n2. **Delivery Information:**  In parallel with the container actions, the client's location is obtained.  This is used to estimate the distance and the delivery time. If the distance is less than 300km, the estimated delivery time is then checked.  If the delivery time is \"ok,\" the process continues. If it's \"nok\" or the distance is 300km or more, a route change request is generated and eventually rejoins the main flow.\n\n3. **Goods Information:** The final parallel branch involves getting the goods status and, concurrently, estimating the goods status.  If any damage is detected in the estimated status, the extent of the damage is evaluated. If the goods are \"ruined,\" a removal request is generated. If the goods are \"compromised,\" a price change request is generated.  If there is no damage, the process simply proceeds.\n\nOnce all three parallel branches (container, delivery, and goods) are complete, all generated messages (standard notifications, container change requests, route change requests, removal requests, and price change requests) are sent. After the messages are sent, the process ends.\n",

If the temperature values are anything else, multiple parallel processes begin.\n\nThe first parallel process involves getting the container status and then estimating that status.  Based on the estimated status, if it's \"ok,\" a request to change the container is generated. Regardless of whether the container status is \"ok\" or \"nok,\" this branch of the parallel process converges to the point where parallel processes combine and continue as a single process.\n\nThe second parallel process starts by getting the client's location, followed by estimating the delivery time.  If the estimated duration is \"ok,\" the process proceeds. If not, a route change request is generated.  Regardless, this path converges back to the point where parallel processes combine.\n\nThe third parallel process initiates by getting the goods status and then estimating it.  If damages are detected (\"yes\"), they are evaluated. If not (\"no\"), the process skips evaluation.  If the damage is \"ruined,\" a removal request is generated. If the damage is \"compromised,\" a price change request is generated.  Regardless of the evaluation outcome, this path also converges back to the point where the parallel processes come together as a single flow.\n\nAfter all three parallel processes complete, the generated messages (which can include a standard notification, container change request, route change request, removal request, or price change request, depending on the conditions met throughout the process), are sent.  Once the messages are sent, the process ends.\n",

We check if there are any recipients for the data.\n6. We check if there are legitimate interests for processing the data.\n7. We retrieve the processing's legal basis.\n8. We retrieve the purposes of the processing.\n9. We begin collecting the identity and contact details of the Data Protection Officer (DPO).\n\nAfter checking if it's possible to determine the data storage period, we decide whether it's possible. If it *is* possible, we retrieve the period. If it's *not* possible, we retrieve the criteria used to determine the period.  Both paths eventually lead to the same point where we go back to complete the actions started earlier.\n\nAfter checking if the data was obtained from the data subject, we either retrieve the source of the data (if it *wasn't* obtained directly) or proceed with other actions if it *was* obtained directly.  Again, both paths rejoin the main flow.\n\nAfter collecting the DPO's identity and contact details, we ask for the DPO details and simultaneously wait to receive them. Once received, these details are combined with the other information gathered in the parallel tasks.\n\nOnce all the parallel tasks (including adding descriptions of data rights, checking for international transfers, checking for recipients, and retrieving legal basis and purposes) are finished, we proceed to prepare a consent request and then ask for consent.\n\nIf the person consents, we collect their consent information.  If they refuse, we receive their negation.  Both outcomes lead to the final step, where the process ends.\n",

This then feeds into the parallel actions.\n    * **If recipients are *not present***: We go directly to the parallel actions.\n* Checking if legitimate interests are present. This leads to a decision:\n    * **If legitimate interests are *present***: We retrieve the legitimate interests, feeding into the parallel actions.\n    * **If legitimate interests are *not present***:  We go directly to the parallel actions that follow step 1.\n* Retrieving the processing legal basis and the processing purposes. Each of these independently feeds into the parallel actions.\n* Finally, we retrieve identity and contact details and concurrently ask for DPO details. The retrieval of identity and contact details leads to two more concurrent actions:\n* Retrieving the identity and contact details also leads to asking for consent.\n* In parallel with asking for DPO details, receiving the details back from the DPO feeds into the parallel actions that follow step 1. \n\nFollowing the confluence of all these parallel activities after step 1, we collect consent information. This then leads to asking for consent, resulting in two possible outcomes:\n\n* **Consent is received**: The process ends.\n* **Consent is not received (negation)**: The process ends.\n",

We add information about the logic, significance, and consequences of data processing.  After this, we proceed to check if it's possible to determine how long personal data will be stored.\n\n2. At the same time as step 1, we also check if the data has been obtained directly from the data subject.\n\n3. Alongside steps 1 and 2, we also do the following in parallel:\n    * Add information about the right to rectify personal data.\n    * Add information about the right to access personal data.\n    * Add information about the right to erase personal data.\n    * Add information about the right to data portability.\n    * Add information about the right to withdraw consent.\n    * Add information about the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\n    * Check if personal data can be transferred internationally.\n    * Check if there are any recipients of the data.\n    * Check if there are legitimate interests for processing the data.\n    * Retrieve the legal basis for processing.\n    * Retrieve the purposes of processing.\n    * Retrieve the identity and contact details of the data controller.\n    * Begin the process to identify a Data Protection Officer (DPO).\n\nLet's look at some of these parallel branches in more detail:\n\n* **Data storage period:** If it's *not* possible to determine the storage period, we retrieve the criteria used to determine it.  If it *is* possible to determine the storage period, we retrieve the period itself.  In either case, after retrieving the relevant information (criteria or period), these branches converge.\n\n* **Data source:** If the data was *not* obtained from the data subject, we retrieve the source of the data. If the data *was* obtained from the data subject, we skip this step. Both paths then converge.\n\n* **Data recipients:** If recipients are present, we retrieve them. If not, we skip this step. Both paths then converge.\n\n* **Legitimate interests:** If legitimate interests are present, we retrieve them.  If not, we skip this step. Both paths then converge.\n\n* **Data Protection Officer (DPO):**  After initiating the process to identify a DPO, we request their details.  Upon receiving these details, this information is added to the main process flow.\n\nOnce all of the above parallel branches have completed, several actions occur in parallel, including gathering all the collected information and beginning the consent process. This involves collecting consent information, asking for consent, and then waiting for a response.\n\nThe process then splits based on the response:\n\n* **Consent given:** If consent is given, the process ends.\n* **Consent denied:** If consent is denied, the process also ends.\n",
