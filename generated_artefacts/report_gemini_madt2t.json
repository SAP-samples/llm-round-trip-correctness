After the contract is sent, three tasks happen at the same time: scheduling future calls, updating the client's CRM, and updating the project management profile.\n\nOnce the future calls are scheduled, there are two paths that can be taken, potentially both: getting approval for the first draft and creating the first draft of the marketing plan. If the first draft is created, the next step is to research campaign ideas.\n\nMeanwhile, once the project management profile is updated, the next step is to confirm that the questionnaire is complete.  Regardless of whether the first draft was approved or created and campaign ideas researched, and regardless of whether the questionnaire was completed, the next step is to inform the client of the project start. This happens only after all the previously mentioned parallel tasks are finished.\n\nAfter informing the client, three final tasks happen concurrently: making changes based on a follow-up call, having the follow-up call itself, and sending a post-onboarding survey.  Once each of these three tasks is complete, the process ends.\n",

This assessment branches into three parallel paths: considering bottlenecks, looking for simplification opportunities, and defining the process completion time.  \n\nFollowing the simplification check, two more parallel paths emerge: examining wasteful steps and assessing confusing steps.  The results from considering bottlenecks, defining completion time, examining wasteful steps, and assessing confusing steps all feed into writing potential process improvements.\n\nAfter documenting potential improvements, approval is sought.  Upon receiving approval, two parallel actions occur: adding feedback on the updated process and updating the process documents.\n\nOnce the process documents are updated, three parallel actions are triggered: scheduling the next process review, determining how the process will be monitored, and communicating the process changes.  Finally, the process changes are implemented, and the process ends.\n",

While looking for simplification opportunities, two further parallel activities occur: examining wasteful steps and assessing confusing steps.  All of these separate activities \u2013 considering bottlenecks, looking for simplification, defining completion time, examining wasteful steps, and assessing confusing steps \u2013 feed into the task of writing potential process improvements.\n\nAfter documenting potential improvements, approval for these improvements is sought.  Once approved, two parallel activities begin: adding feedback on the updated process and updating the process documents.  After both feedback and documentation are complete, three final parallel activities take place: scheduling the next process review, determining how the process will be monitored, and communicating the process changes.  Once the changes are communicated, they are implemented, and the process ends.\n",

Once payment is confirmed, three actions happen simultaneously: products are taken from storage and recorded, the products undergo quality checks, and a request for the products is sent to inventory.  After these three parallel actions are completed, the system prints a packing slip.\n\nWhile the packing slip is being printed, two more actions happen concurrently: the items are securely packaged and an invoice is printed.  After the invoice is printed, the products' measurements are recorded.\n\nMeanwhile, approval is requested.  Once the products are packaged, the measurements are taken, and approval is granted, these three paths converge.  The next step is to examine other orders to see if there are any delivery overlaps.  Finally, a confirmation email is sent to the customer, and the order is fulfilled.\n",

Following this, three actions can happen concurrently: recording whether the customer responded, giving the customer a call, and recording if they are willing to talk.  It's important to note that all three of these actions don't necessarily need to happen, but any combination of them can.\n\nOnce these actions are completed, two more actions happen concurrently: confirming the call date and time, and sending the customer an email.  After both of these are done, the user identifies the root cause(s) of any problems.\n\nThe user then describes their ideas to increase value.  After this, two more actions can happen concurrently: recording the customer's decision and thanking them for their time and feedback.  Regardless of which of these two actions (or both) occur, the user then asks the customer if they have any other concerns.\n\nFinally, two more actions happen concurrently: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending those learnings to the appropriate managers.

Following this, we pursue three paths simultaneously: recording whether the customer responded, giving them a call, and recording if they are willing to talk.  Once these three paths are complete, we confirm a call date and time and simultaneously send them an email.  After both the call confirmation and email are sent, we identify the root cause(s) of any problems.  Then, we describe our ideas to increase value to the customer.  After sharing these ideas, we take two simultaneous paths: recording the customer's decision and thanking them for their time and feedback.  Regardless of their decision, we then ask if they have any other concerns. Finally, we pursue two final parallel paths: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending those learnings to the appropriate managers.  Once both of these actions are complete, the process ends.\n",

Following this, three actions can happen concurrently: the user records whether the customer responded, gives the customer a call, and records if the customer is willing to talk.  It's important to note that all three of these actions don't necessarily need to happen, but any combination of them can.\n\nOnce any of these actions are completed, two more actions happen concurrently: confirming the call date and time, and sending the customer an email.  After both the email and call date/time confirmation (if applicable) are handled, the user identifies the root cause(s) of any problems.\n\nThe user then describes their ideas to increase value to the customer.  After this, two more actions can happen concurrently: recording the customer's decision and thanking them for their time and feedback.  Regardless of which of these two actions occur, the user then asks the customer if they have any other concerns.\n\nFinally, two actions happen concurrently: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending those learnings to the appropriate managers.  Once both of these actions are completed, the process ends.\n",

After gaining this knowledge, several tasks can be performed concurrently: specifying the product's rate of growth, market share, and market size.  These tasks don't depend on each other and can happen simultaneously or in any order.\n\nOnce the product's rate of growth is specified, additional concurrent tasks can begin: specifying product details, checking the startup's location, and specifying the product's market size. Again, these can be done in any order.\n\nWhen the product details, startup location, and market size are all defined, the process moves on to review the startup's expertise and business plan. These two reviews can also happen concurrently.\n\nThe review of the business plan leads to a review of the team's chemistry.  Following this, the process branches again into two concurrent tasks: checking the cash flow and checking the exit strategy.\n\nBoth checking the cash flow and the exit strategy are prerequisites for projecting the market share.  Finally, after the market share is projected, the last step is to check patents before the process ends.\n",

If everything is not approved, two tasks happen in parallel: laying out a timeline and drawing up a project plan. Once both the timeline and project plan are complete, the kickoff meeting takes place.  However, if everything *is* approved after the approval status check, the kickoff meeting happens immediately after the approval status is identified, skipping the parallel timeline and project plan tasks.  After the kickoff meeting, two more tasks occur simultaneously: keeping communication open and recording KPIs.  Once both communication is maintained and KPIs are recorded, the project outcomes are evaluated.  The process ends with the evaluation of project outcomes.\n",

You can submit your content to link roundups, and/or you can reverse engineer your competition.\n\nSubmitting to link roundups leads to the next stage, where two more actions happen concurrently: repurposing your content and posting on Q&A sites.  Reverse engineering your competition, however, leads directly to the end of the content promotion process.\n\nAfter posting on Q&A sites, again, you have two paths you can choose to follow, and you can do either one or both: pay for promotion, and/or perform outreach.  Repurposing your content also leads directly to the end of the process.\n\nFinally, both paying for promotion and performing outreach, independently lead to the conclusion of the content promotion process.  Likewise, emailing subscribers also leads to the end of the process, regardless of any other actions taken.\n",

Again, you can do either one, both, or neither.\n\nFinally, all of the parallel branches converge: the emailing of subscribers, the repurposing of content, the posting on Q&A sites, the paying for promotion, the performing outreach, and the reverse-engineering of the competition all conclude at the same point.

If special grades are applied to individuals, then the gradebook is imported before joining back with the other tasks. All three of these potential tasks \u2013 applying score criteria, applying special grades, and preparing grades for SSO \u2013 must be completed before the process continues.  Simultaneously, after the grades are calculated, this process stream waits for the other branch to complete its tasks.\n\nOnce both the assignment selection and grade calculation streams are complete, the process moves on to reviewing the grades summary.  At this point, there may or may not be changes to apply. If there are changes, they are applied, and then the course summary is reviewed. If there are no changes, the course summary is reviewed directly.\n\nAfter the course summary is reviewed, the final grades are exported.

If special grades are applied to individuals, the gradebook is then imported.\n\nThe calculated grades, the imported gradebook (if applicable), the applied score criteria (if applicable), and the prepared grades for SSO (if applicable) are all brought together for a review of the grades summary.  At the same time, any necessary changes can be applied.  Both the review and the application of changes lead to a review of the course summary.\n\nAfter the course summary is reviewed, the final grades are exported.  Finally, two actions occur simultaneously: sending the examiners the grade approval sheet and submitting the results to SSO.  Once both of these actions are complete, the process ends.\n",

After this confirmation, several tasks happen at the same time: updating the client's CRM, getting approval for the first draft, and scheduling future calls.  \n\nOnce the future calls are scheduled, two more parallel tasks begin: confirming the questionnaire is complete and researching campaign ideas.  These two tasks, along with the CRM update, draft approval, happen concurrently.  Only after all four of these tasks (CRM update, draft approval, questionnaire confirmation, and campaign idea research) are finished, does the process move forward.\n\nNext, two more parallel tasks are initiated: assigning work to the team and informing the client of the project start.  After both of these tasks are complete, the process splits again, with one path leading to sending a post-onboarding survey and the other to making changes based on a follow-up call.  It's important to note that these two tasks also happen concurrently.\n\nFinally, after the post-onboarding survey is sent, the process ends.  Separately, once the changes based on the follow-up call are made, the process also concludes.  Therefore, the process has two potential end points, both triggered by completing either the survey task or the follow-up call changes task.\n",

Following this, two actions happen concurrently: the lender gives written notice to the applicant, and the lender sends the application back to the applicant. The applicant then checks the returned application for completeness.\n\nNow, a decision point is reached based on the completeness of the application. If the application is deemed incomplete, it is sent back to the applicant for further review and completion, creating a loop. This check and resubmission process repeats until the application is complete.\n\nOnce the application is complete, and the written notice has been acknowledged, two more processes happen at the same time: the lender begins the underwriting process, and they check the applicant's credit score and risk score.  After both these checks are finished, the lender might decide to reduce the loan amount or change the interest rate, or both.  Finally, regardless of whether the loan amount or interest rate is adjusted, the borrower receives the loan funds, and the process ends.\n",

Simultaneously, posting on Q&A sites leads to performing outreach.  Each of these actions \u2013 deep-linking, outreach, emailing subscribers, posting on forums and groups, and reverse-engineering the competition \u2013 independently lead to the end of the process.\n",

After the initial introduction, several tasks happen at the same time: the employee's workstation is prepared, and their benefits package is put together.  Once both the workstation and benefits package are ready, two more parallel tasks begin: a mentor is assigned to the new employee, and they are given a tour of the office.  After the mentor assignment and office tour are complete, the onboarding process requires approval.  Following approval, two final parallel tasks take place: the employee's long-term goals are explained to them, and the onboarding process itself is reviewed over the next 60 days.  Once both of these final tasks are finished, the onboarding process is complete.\n",

After this confirmation, two actions happen in parallel: identifying process components and assessing the performance of the process.  Once the performance assessment is complete, the process proceeds.  Then, the identification of process components and the performance assessment converge, and two more actions happen in parallel: defining how long the process takes to complete and writing potential process improvements.  The process continues by defining how long the process takes to complete, followed by writing potential process improvements. Next, approval for the proposed process improvements is sought.  After the improvements are approved, the updated process is used, and simultaneously, what would make the improvements successful is defined.  Following this, two more parallel actions take place: communicating the process changes and scheduling the next process review and optimization.  Finally, the process changes are implemented. The process ends after the communication of changes and scheduling of the next review are completed, and the process changes are implemented.\n",

Once both of these parallel tasks are complete, a kickoff meeting takes place.  After the kickoff meeting, two more tasks happen concurrently: keeping communication ongoing and recording KPIs.  The communication task leads to terminating contractors, while the KPI recording task leads to evaluating project outcomes.

After the kickoff meeting, the project again splits into two parallel tracks: ongoing communication and recording Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  The recording of KPIs leads to the termination of contractors.

After this confirmation, two actions happen at the same time: assessing the performance of the process and identifying its components.  Once the process components are identified, the need for optimization is confirmed.  Simultaneously, the performance assessment completes.  These two parallel streams converge, and then another set of parallel actions begin: assessing if any steps are confusing and noting which steps can be automated.  At the same time as assessing for confusing steps, two more parallel actions occur: defining how long the process takes to complete and examining potentially wasteful steps.  These three parallel streams then converge.  Next, potential process improvements are written, followed by getting approval for those improvements.  Once approved, two parallel actions occur: using the updated process and determining what improvements should go forward.  When both of these are complete, another set of parallel actions begin: communicating process changes and scheduling the next process review and optimization.  Finally, after both the communication and scheduling are complete, the process ends.\n",

The identification of components leads to confirming if the process requires optimization.  Once both performance assessment and optimization confirmation are complete, another set of parallel tracks starts.  These involve assessing if any steps are confusing and noting which steps can be automated.  After both of these assessments are finished, yet another pair of parallel tracks commences: defining how long the process takes to complete and examining potentially wasteful steps.  Once both time assessment and waste examination are done, the potential process improvements are written.  These improvements are then submitted for approval.  After approval, two final parallel tracks begin: using the updated process and determining what improvements should go forward.  Finally, after both the updated process is in use and the improvements are determined, the process changes are communicated and the next process review and optimization is scheduled. The process then ends.\n",

After this confirmation, two actions happen in parallel: assessing the performance of the process and identifying its components.  Once the process components are identified, the need for optimization is confirmed.  Meanwhile, the performance assessment completes independently.  When both these parallel paths are finished, they converge.\n\nNext, three more actions happen concurrently: assessing if any steps are confusing, noting which steps can be automated, and defining how long the process takes to complete.  Within the automation assessment, two further parallel actions occur: defining how long the process takes and examining potentially wasteful steps. These two sub-processes finish independently and then converge back to the automation assessment. Once all three initial parallel actions are complete, they converge. This leads to writing potential process improvements, which are then submitted for approval.\n\nAfter approval, two final parallel actions take place: using the updated process and determining what improvements should go forward.  While the updated process is being used, the improvements are also being determined. These two parallel paths converge.  Finally, the process changes are communicated, the next process review and optimization is scheduled, and the entire process ends.\n",

These actions can be done concurrently.\n\nAfter repurposing the content, there are final promotional activities available.  You can post on Q&A sites and/or pay for promotion.

Following this, several parallel promotion channels are utilized.  Sharing on social media happens concurrently with commenting on related blog posts.  After commenting on blog posts,  posting on related forums and groups is done alongside deep-linking to the content from older posts.  These two actions can happen in any order or at the same time.  Once the forum and group posting is complete, outreach and repurposing the content occur in parallel.  After repurposing the content, two further promotion options become available: posting on Q&A sites and paying for promotion. These two actions can also happen in any order or at the same time. The process ends when all these parallel branches of promotion activities are completed.  Social media sharing, deep-linking, outreach, Q&A site posting, and paid promotion all conclude independently, marking the end of the content promotion process.\n",

Following the introduction, three tasks happen concurrently: recording the basic idea, working out its value, and identifying the approval status.  While the basic idea is being recorded, the next step is to get approval.  Once the value is worked out, the approval status is identified, and approval is obtained, these three parallel streams converge.\n\nNext, another set of three parallel tasks begins: laying out a timeline, stating the available resources, and drawing up a project plan.  When all three of these tasks are complete, they converge and lead to a kickoff meeting.\n\nAfter the kickoff meeting, two final parallel tasks occur: keeping communication and recording KPIs.  Once both communication is maintained and KPIs are recorded, these streams converge, leading to the evaluation of project outcomes.  The process then ends.\n",

Following the introduction, three parallel tracks begin: recording the basic idea, working out its value, and identifying the approval status.  The \"record the basic idea\" track leads directly to getting approval.  Meanwhile, the other two tracks, \"work out its value\" and \"identify the approval status,\" along with the \"get approval\" step, converge. Once all three of these activities are complete, three more parallel tracks begin: laying out a timeline, stating the available resources, and drawing up a project plan.  After these three parallel tracks are finished, they converge, leading to a kickoff meeting.  Following the kickoff meeting, two final parallel tracks begin: keeping communication and recording KPIs.  Both of these tracks lead to the evaluation of project outcomes, which then concludes the process.\n",

After this initial step, three tasks happen in parallel: specifying product details, specifying product market size, and specifying product rate of growth.  Once the product rate of growth is specified, the process moves on to making plans for future products.  Following this, there's a review of ability as a team leader.  Next, quarterly projections are checked, which leads to analyzing the growth stage of competition.  This analysis then triggers three more parallel tasks: checking trademarks, checking past lawsuits, and checking insurance.  The checking of trademarks is followed by checking patents.

Once all three of these parallel tasks are completed, they all feed into the next step: making plans for future products.\n\nFollowing the future product plans, the process moves on to reviewing ability as a team leader.  This then leads to checking quarterly projections, which in turn leads to analyzing the growth stage of competition.\n\nAfter analyzing the competition, another set of three parallel tasks begins: checking trademarks, checking past lawsuits, and checking insurance.  Once each of these three checks are complete, they all converge to the next step: checking patents.  Finally, after the patent check, the process ends.\n",

Next, they are given an office tour.\n\nAfter the tour, three parallel processes begin: getting approval for the new hire's position, explaining expectations for their first month, and assigning their first project.  These three processes can occur in any order, but all must be completed before moving forward.\n\nOnce these three tasks are finished, two more parallel processes begin: providing reading material for personal growth and encouraging social interaction with the team. Again, these can happen in any order.\n\nAfter the reading material and social encouragement are complete, two final parallel processes begin: explaining the long-term goals for the new hire's role and reviewing the onboarding process over the next 60 days.  These too can occur in any order.  Once both of these final steps are complete, the onboarding process ends.\n",

After commenting on blog posts, three further parallel actions can be taken: posting on Q&A sites, submitting to link roundups, and reverse-engineering your competition.

These three tasks can happen simultaneously.\n\nFrom the \"Commenting on related blog posts\" task, two more parallel actions branch out: posting on related forums and groups, and posting on Q&A sites.  These two tasks can also happen concurrently.\n\nFollowing the \"Posting on Q&A sites\" task, two final parallel actions begin: submitting to link roundups and sharing on social media. Again, these can be done at the same time.\n\nOnce deep-linking, repurposing content, and posting on forums and groups are complete, they converge.  Similarly, once submitting to link roundups and sharing on social media are complete, they also converge.  Finally, this entire set of parallel activities, along with the deep-linking and repurposing activities, all converge, marking the end of the content promotion process.\n",

After the requisition is created, two approvals are needed simultaneously: one from the finance team and another from the manager.

After the supplier provides their approval and the purchase order is created, the process continues. The supplier's approval also triggers a separate task of recording the purchase order.  Next, the relevant department is sent the details, and the delivery date is confirmed. Finally, the purchase order is filed, and the process ends.\n",

After the target date is set, two tasks happen at the same time: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once both of these reviews and evaluations are complete, the focus shifts to determining ways of achieving the goals.\n\nNext, three tasks are performed concurrently: calculating the total annual budget, estimating the average monthly cost, and projecting the total annual income.  After the annual budget and monthly cost are calculated, they feed into the process of projecting total annual income. Once the income projection is complete, two paths become possible: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, or finalizing the budget.  These paths can be taken individually or simultaneously.\n\nIf the financial data is recorded in the spreadsheet, the next step is to request approval from top management.  If the budget is finalized, the next step is to assign management responsibilities, followed by obtaining approval from top management. Regardless of which path was taken (spreadsheet or finalization, or both), the process concludes after management approval is either requested or obtained, and after management responsibilities are assigned and approved, with incorporating the budget into the master budget. The entire process ends once both branches are completed.\n",

Following this, two tasks happen concurrently: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once both of these reviews and evaluations are complete, the focus shifts to determining ways of achieving the goals.\n\nNext, two more parallel tasks take place: calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost.  After both calculations are finished, the total annual income is projected.\n\nThe next stage involves another set of parallel tasks: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget.  Once these tasks are completed, there are two potential paths: requesting approval from top management, or assigning management responsibilities.  It's possible that both paths are taken, or just one, or even neither.\n\nIf management responsibilities are assigned, then two final parallel tasks occur: obtaining approval from top management and incorporating the budget into the master budget.  Regardless of whether approval was requested initially, or management responsibilities were assigned, the process ends once top management approval is obtained and the budget is incorporated into the master budget.  If neither of the paths after finalizing the budget are taken, the process ends after requesting approval from top management.\n",

Following this, two tasks happen concurrently: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once both of these reviews and evaluations are complete, the focus shifts to determining ways of achieving the goals.\n\nNext, three tasks are performed in parallel: calculating the total annual budget, estimating the average monthly cost, and projecting the total annual income.  The annual budget and monthly cost estimations feed into the projection of annual income.  After these are finished, two paths can be taken, potentially at the same time: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, and finalizing the budget.\n\nIf the data is recorded in the spreadsheet, the next step is to request approval from top management.  If the budget is finalized, the next step is to assign management responsibilities.  Requesting top management approval concludes one branch of the process. Assigning management responsibilities leads to two final steps, which can also happen at the same time: obtaining approval from top management and incorporating the budget into the master budget.  Once all of these final tasks are completed, the entire process ends.\n",

After this, several tasks happen in parallel: confirming if the process requires optimization, and identifying process components. Once both of these parallel tasks are complete, three more tasks are tackled concurrently: defining how long the process takes to complete, noting which steps can be automated, and considering where bottlenecks occur.\n\nFollowing this, two more sets of parallel tasks take place. The first set involves assessing if any steps are confusing and looking to see if the process can be simplified.  These two tasks happen at the same time as the task of examining potentially wasteful steps, which follows directly from considering bottlenecks.  Once the \"confusing steps\" and \"simplification\" tasks are finished, they converge.  Separately, examining wasteful steps leads into writing potential process improvements.\n\nAfter the potential improvements are written, they need approval.  Once approval is sought, two final parallel tasks occur: determining which improvements should go forward and adding feedback on the updated process.  After both of these are complete, the process concludes with two final concurrent tasks: determining how the process will be monitored and communicating the process changes.  Once these last two tasks are finished, the entire process is complete.\n",

The user confirms if the process requires optimization and, at the same time, identifies the process components.  These two tracks converge, and then the user defines how long the process takes to complete, notes which steps can be automated, and considers where bottlenecks occur, all in parallel.\n\nThe track examining process completion time splits.  Concurrently, the user assesses if any steps are confusing and looks to see if the process can be simplified.  These two tracks then converge.  Meanwhile, the bottleneck track merges with the tracks for noting automation opportunities and examining potentially wasteful steps.  All of these converge, and the user writes potential process improvements.\n\nNext, the user gets approval for these improvements.  Another set of parallel actions begins: the user determines which improvements should go forward and adds feedback on the updated process.  This is a repeating cycle \u2013 the output of each of these tasks feeds back into the other, allowing for iterative refinement.  Once this cycle is complete, the user determines how the process will be monitored and communicates the process changes.  These final two tasks happen in parallel, and once both are finished, the process ends.\n",

After this confirmation, several tasks happen in parallel: confirming if the process requires optimization and identifying the process's components. Once both of these parallel tasks are complete, three more tasks are performed concurrently: defining how long the process takes, noting which steps can be automated, and considering where bottlenecks occur.\n\nNext, the process branches again.  While defining the process completion time also triggers two parallel tasks \u2013 assessing if any steps are confusing and looking to see if the process can be simplified \u2013 considering bottlenecks leads to examining potentially wasteful steps. The two parallel branches stemming from \"define how long it takes\" converge once both assessing confusion and simplification are finished.  Separately, examining wasteful steps leads to writing potential process improvements.\n\nAt this point, the outputs from \"assessing confusion,\" \"looking for simplification,\" and \"writing potential process improvements\" all feed into getting approval for those improvements.  After gaining approval, two final parallel tasks occur: determining which improvements should go forward and adding feedback on the updated process.  The simplified process assessment also feeds into this parallel split.  Once both of these tasks, along with the converged tasks from the earlier parallel split, are complete, the process splits one last time into two parallel tasks: determining how the process will be monitored and communicating the process changes.  The process ends after both of these final tasks are completed.\n",

Both of these paths converge to finalize the budget.\n\nOnce the budget is finalized, there are two possible paths, or both, related to approvals and management responsibilities: assigning management responsibilities or obtaining approval from top management.

Based on this evaluation, the process branches into two paths, though both paths may be followed simultaneously. One path involves prioritizing three to five goals, while the other involves defining three to five goals. Regardless of which path is taken, or if both are taken, the next step is to calculate the total annual budget.  \n\nAfter the budget is calculated, two parallel actions take place: projecting the total annual income and listing all sources of income. Once both of these are complete, the budget is finalized.\n\nFinalizing the budget triggers two more parallel actions: assigning management responsibilities and obtaining approval from top management.  Assigning management responsibilities leads to another decision point: how to obtain approval. This may involve requesting approval from top management or incorporating the budget into the master budget, or both.  Obtaining approval from top management directly, incorporating the budget into the master budget, or both actions together, mark the end of the process.\n",

The first involves confirming if the process requires optimization, followed by assessing if any steps are confusing. The second parallel track involves identifying the process's components, followed by considering where bottlenecks occur.\n\nOnce both \"assessing confusing steps\" and \"considering bottlenecks\" are complete, two more parallel tracks begin. One track focuses on defining how long the process takes and looking to see if it can be simplified. The other track examines potentially wasteful steps, which then leads to writing potential process improvements.\n\nAfter the potential improvements are written, approval for those improvements is sought.  Once approved, two parallel activities occur: defining what would make the improvements successful and choosing who will test the updated process.\n\nAfter the testers are chosen and the success criteria are defined, two more parallel activities begin: updating the process documents and using the updated process.  Finally, after both the documents are updated and the process is in use, the process changes are communicated and implemented in parallel. The process ends once both communication and implementation are complete.\n",

These may or may not all be relevant, but are evaluated as needed: Are any steps confusing? Where do bottlenecks occur?  These assessments can happen in any order or even simultaneously.  Once completed, the process continues.\n\nNow, two more parallel tasks take place: defining how long the process takes to complete and looking to see if the process can be simplified.  At the same time, a separate task examines potentially wasteful steps.  Once all three of these tasks are finished, the potential process improvements are written down.\n\nAfter documenting the potential improvements, approval for these improvements is sought.  Once approved, two more parallel tasks occur: defining what would make the improvements successful and choosing who will test the updated process.  When both tasks are complete, the process moves forward.\n\nNext, the process documents are updated and the updated process is used. These two tasks can happen in any order or at the same time.  Simultaneously, the success criteria defined earlier are evaluated. Once all three of these tasks are complete, the process continues.\n\nFinally, the process changes are communicated and implemented. These two tasks can happen in any order or at the same time.

After this, several activities happen in parallel: confirming if the process needs optimization and identifying the process components. Once both of these parallel activities are complete, the process proceeds to evaluate potential issues. This evaluation includes assessing if any steps are confusing and considering where bottlenecks occur.\n\nIf any steps are deemed confusing, the process branches to define how long the current process takes and look for simplification opportunities. These two actions are also performed in parallel.  Regardless of whether steps are confusing or not, if bottlenecks are identified, the process examines potentially wasteful steps.  After examining wasteful steps, potential process improvements are written.\n\nOnce the duration and simplification aspects (if applicable) are defined, and the potential improvements are written (if bottlenecks were identified), these paths converge.  The process then moves to get approval for the proposed improvements.\n\nAfter approval is obtained, the process splits again.  This time, defining what would make the improvements successful and choosing who will test the updated process happen concurrently.  These two activities, along with the earlier simplification and duration definition (if those paths were followed), all converge before updating the process documents and using the updated process. These two actions, updating and using, also occur in parallel.\n\nFinally, after both the updated process is in use and the documents are updated, the process splits one last time. Communicating the process changes and implementing the changes happen concurrently. Once both of these final activities are complete, the entire process ends.\n",

After assessing confusing steps, the process defines how long it takes to complete the process and looks to see if the process can be simplified.

After this, two actions happen in parallel: assessing the performance of the current process and identifying the process's components. Once both of these are complete, the process moves forward.\n\nNext, several improvement opportunities are explored.  The process considers which steps can be automated and if any steps are confusing.  It's possible that identifying confusing steps happens only after noting which steps can be automated, or it could be that both happen independently, or even that identifying confusing steps leads to discovering automation opportunities.  Regardless of the order or dependencies, both of these assessments must be finished before moving on.\n\nOnce the automation and confusion assessments are complete, the process splits again. This time, defining how long the process takes and looking to see if the process can be simplified are handled concurrently.  After completing \"Define how long it takes to complete the process\", the process continues. Separately, after completing \"Looking to see if the process can be simplified\", two more parallel actions take place: considering where bottlenecks occur and examining potentially wasteful steps.  Again, these can happen independently or one might lead to the other, but both must be finished before moving forward. Once all branches \u2013 defining the process time, considering bottlenecks, and examining wasteful steps \u2013 are complete, the process converges.\n\nThe next step is writing the potential process improvements.  This is followed by getting approval for those improvements, then updating the process documents, and finally, communicating the process changes.  Once the changes are communicated, the process ends.\n",

After this confirmation, two actions happen at the same time: assessing the performance of the process and identifying the process's components. Once both of these assessments and identifications are complete, the process moves forward.\n\nNext, the process considers several improvement opportunities.  It checks if any steps can be automated and if any steps are confusing.  It's possible that automating steps might also clarify confusing ones, so if automation is identified, the assessment of confusing steps is also considered complete.  After considering these two aspects, the process moves forward.\n\nNow, three more evaluations occur simultaneously: defining how long the process takes, looking for simplification opportunities, and examining potentially wasteful steps.  Once the time is defined, the process continues. Separately, after looking for simplification opportunities, the process also considers where bottlenecks occur and examines potentially wasteful steps. Once all three of these evaluations are finished, the process moves forward.\n\nThe next step is to write potential process improvements based on all the previous analysis.  After documenting these improvements, they need approval.  Once approved, the process documents are updated to reflect the changes. Finally, the process changes are communicated, and the entire process is complete.\n",

Once both the monthly cost and annual budget are determined, all sources of income are listed.  \n\nWith the income sources documented, the budget is finalized.

            "text": "Category: Budgeting and Finance\nTitle: Budget Preparation Process\n\nThe budget preparation process begins with recording basic details.  Following this, the most recent budget is reviewed.  Next, there's a decision to be made on how to approach goal setting.  This could involve any or all of the following happening concurrently: prioritizing existing goals, defining new goals, and determining ways to achieve those goals. It's important to note that all selected paths must be completed before moving forward.\n\nOnce the chosen goal-setting activities are complete, two parallel processes begin: estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget.  After both of these calculations are finished, all sources of income are listed.  With income information in hand, the budget is finalized.  The final step is to obtain approval from top management, which signifies the completion of the budget preparation process.\n",

One path involves estimating the average monthly cost, while the other involves calculating the total annual budget.  Regardless of which path is taken, they both converge and lead to listing all sources of income.\n\nAfter listing income sources, two more tasks happen in parallel: finalizing the budget and recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet.

Following this, two tasks are performed concurrently: evaluating any significant variances and reviewing the most recent budget. Once both of these tasks are complete, the next step is to prioritize three to five goals.\n\nAfter the goals are prioritized, the process branches based on certain conditions.  Estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget can happen in any order, or even simultaneously.  Regardless of the order, both must be completed before moving forward.\n\nNext, listing all sources of income occurs.  This leads to two more parallel tasks: finalizing the budget and recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet.  Again, these tasks can occur in any order or at the same time, but both must be finished before the process can proceed.\n\nFinally, the budget preparation process concludes.\n",

After that, two tasks happen at the same time: specifying the product rate of growth and making plans for future products. Once both of these are complete, the company mission and direction are reviewed.\n\nNext, another set of parallel tasks begins: checking quarterly projections and checking current debt.  While the current debt is being checked, two more tasks happen concurrently: checking cash flow and checking income statements.  These two financial checks conclude, and their results are combined before feeding into the completion of the debt check.  Meanwhile, checking quarterly projections leads to checking the exit strategy.  Once the debt check, exit strategy check, and the combined financial checks are all finished, another parallel process starts.\n\nThis new set of parallel tasks involves knowing the exact competition and analyzing the growth stage of competition.  When both of these analyses are done, two more parallel tasks begin: analyzing the reputation of the competition and projecting the market share.  After these are complete, the final task is checking trademarks.  Once trademarks are checked, the process ends.\n",

At this point, three paths can be followed simultaneously or individually: reporting any errors to the relevant team member, gathering the receiving report, and gathering the vendor's invoice.  \n\nOnce any errors have been reported, the process continues.  Similarly, the process moves forward once the receiving report and vendor's invoice have been gathered.  These three paths converge, leading to two simultaneous actions: double-checking the three-way match between the purchase order, receiving report, and invoice, and confirming that all documents have been amended if necessary.\n\nIf any documents required amendments, once they are confirmed, the process proceeds.  The three-way match check and document amendment confirmation both need to be completed before moving forward.  At this stage, three actions happen in parallel: stamping all documents, storing the documents in the paid invoice file, and checking dates to avoid penalty charges.\n\nAfter the documents are stamped, a voucher is created for them.  Checking the dates concludes one part of the process.  Once the documents are stored in the paid invoice file, two final actions occur concurrently: entering the invoice into the accounts payable account and scheduling the payment.  Creating the voucher, entering the invoice into accounts payable, scheduling the payment, and checking the dates all lead to the end of the process.\n",

At this point, several paths can be taken simultaneously: errors can be reported to the relevant team member, the receiving report can be gathered, and the vendor's invoice can be gathered.  Once the vendor's invoice is gathered, there are a couple of possible next steps that may happen concurrently: a three-way match is double-checked and it is confirmed that all documents have been amended.  These actions lead to a point where several tasks happen in parallel: all documents are stamped, the documents are stored in a paid invoice file, and dates are checked to avoid penalty charges.  After the documents are stamped, a voucher is created for them.  After the paid invoice file storage, the invoice is entered into the accounts payable account and the payment is scheduled.  Checking the dates, creating the voucher, entering the invoice, and scheduling the payment all independently conclude the process.\n",

This leads into identifying the root cause(s) of the problem.\n\nAfter identifying the root cause, there are three possible strategies that can be employed independently or in combination: describing ideas to increase value, presenting a special offer, or informing the individual of key metrics demonstrating value.\n\nAll three of these strategies converge at the next step: thanking the individual for their time and feedback.  Following this, they are asked if they have any other concerns.  Finally, important learnings from the conversation are noted down, and the process ends.\n",

The first involves preparing grades for the Student Services Online (SSO) system.  Simultaneously, the exam assignment is selected, and the scoring criteria are applied.\n\nOnce the scoring criteria are defined, three more parallel actions begin: calculating the grades, importing the gradebook, and applying any special grades to individual students.  These three actions, along with the two from the previous parallel set (preparing grades for SSO and selecting the exam assignment) all converge.\n\nFollowing this convergence, another set of three parallel actions takes place: reviewing the grades summary, reviewing the course summary, and applying any changes.  These three actions converge, leading to the recalculation of the grades.\n\nFinally, the recalculated grades are submitted to the SSO system, concluding the process.\n",

Following this, approvals are needed, and this can happen in two ways: either the manager approves it, or the finance team approves it, or both.\n\nRegardless of which approval route is taken (manager, finance, or both), the process continues on two parallel paths. On one path, the supplier is informed that the order is ready for their approval.  Simultaneously, on the other path, a purchase order is created.\n\nOnce both the supplier notification and the purchase order creation are complete, the process converges and awaits supplier approval.\n\nAfter the supplier approves, there are again two possible paths: either the delivery date is confirmed, or the purchase order is recorded, or both.\n\nIf the delivery date is confirmed, the purchase order is then filed.  If the purchase order is recorded, the process ends.  If both the delivery date is confirmed and the purchase order is recorded, then after the purchase order is filed, the process ends.\n",

Following introductions, the new employee discusses their role, goals, and projects with their supervisor.  \n\nNext, several things happen at the same time: the supervisor assigns training materials and takes the new employee out to lunch.  While this is happening, the supervisor also initiates a welcoming ceremony, explains expectations, and gives a tour of the office.  These three actions happen concurrently. Once lunch is over, the welcoming ceremony is complete, expectations are explained, and the office tour is finished, the supervisor assigns a mentor and begins to induct the new employee into the company culture.  Simultaneously, the new employee works through the assigned training materials.  Once the training materials are reviewed, the mentor is assigned, and the company culture introduction is complete, the supervisor assigns the first project.\n\nAfter the first project is assigned, the supervisor plans check-in meetings, explains long-term goals, and provides reading material for personal growth. These three actions occur concurrently.  Once the check-in meetings are planned and the long-term goals are explained, the supervisor encourages the new employee to socially interact with the team.  Meanwhile, the new employee reviews the provided reading material for personal growth.  Finally, the onboarding process concludes after the new employee interacts with the team and the supervisor reviews the entire onboarding process over the next 60 days.\n",

Following the introductions, the new hire discusses their role, goals, and projects with their supervisor.  \n\nNext, several things happen at the same time: the supervisor assigns training materials and takes the new hire out to lunch.  While this is happening, lunch leads to a few concurrent activities: a welcoming ceremony is held, expectations are explained, and the new hire is given an office tour.  Once the welcoming ceremony is complete, a mentor is assigned.  As the explanation of expectations wraps up, the new hire is inducted into the company culture.  The office tour, mentor assignment, and company culture induction all converge before the next step.\n\nAfter these parallel activities are finished, the supervisor assigns the first project.  The first project assignment then kicks off another set of concurrent activities: check-in meetings are planned, long-term goals are explained, and reading material for personal growth is provided.  Following the planning of check-in meetings, the new hire is encouraged to interact socially with the team.  Meanwhile, the new hire reviews the onboarding process over the next 60 days after receiving the personal growth reading material.  Finally, the social interaction encouragement, the onboarding review, and the explanation of long-term goals all conclude, marking the end of the onboarding process.\n",

This discussion then triggers several parallel activities: assigning training materials and taking the new employee out to lunch.  After lunch, another set of parallel activities begins: holding a welcoming ceremony, explaining expectations, and giving a tour of the office.  Once the welcoming ceremony is complete, a mentor is assigned.  After the expectations are explained, the new employee is inducted into the company culture.  All of these activities \u2013 assigning training materials, the office tour, the welcoming ceremony, explaining expectations, and the culture induction \u2013 must be completed before the first project is assigned.  After the first project is assigned, another set of parallel activities commences: planning check-in meetings, explaining long-term goals, and providing reading material for personal growth.  Once the check-in meetings are planned, the new employee is encouraged to interact socially with the team.  Finally, the onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days, after which the long-term goals explanation, providing reading material, and social encouragement should be completed.  The entire process concludes once the 60-day review and the social encouragement are finished.\n",

After this point, three actions happen simultaneously: an email is sent to the customer, a call date and time is confirmed with the customer, and the customer is called.\n\nFollowing the email, whether or not the customer responded is recorded.  After the call, whether the customer was willing to talk is recorded.  The information from the email response, the call itself, and the confirmed call time are all used to summarize why the customer wants to leave.\n\nOnce the summary of the customer's reasons for leaving is complete, two actions happen in parallel: ideas to increase value for the customer are described, and the customer is informed of key metrics demonstrating the existing value.\n\nAfter both the value-increasing ideas and the value demonstration metrics have been addressed, the customer is thanked for their time and feedback, and their final decision is recorded.  Regardless of the customer's decision, they are asked if they have any other concerns. Finally, important learnings from the conversation are noted down, and the process ends.\n",

Then, there are three possible ways to contact the customer: sending an email, confirming a call date and time, or directly giving them a call.  These options can occur individually or in combination.\n\nIf an email is sent, the user records whether or not the customer responded. If a call is made, the user records if the customer was willing to talk. If a call time was confirmed, the process proceeds directly to understanding the reasons for cancellation. Regardless of the chosen communication method(s), the next step is to summarize why the customer wants to leave.\n\nAfter understanding the reasons, there are two possible approaches to increase customer value: describing ideas to enhance value or informing the customer of key metrics demonstrating existing value. These options, again, can be pursued individually or together.\n\nFollowing the value proposition, the user thanks the customer for their time and feedback, and records the customer's decision.  Regardless of whether value-add suggestions were offered or key metrics were presented, the user thanks the customer and records their decision.  Then, the user asks if the customer has any other concerns. Finally, important learnings from the conversation are noted down, and the process ends.\n",

Following this, two parallel actions take place: checking product availability and recording which products are pulled from storage.  Once availability is confirmed, the ordered products are requested from inventory.  Simultaneously, the products taken from storage undergo quality checks.  After both the inventory request and quality checks are complete, the items are securely packaged and approval is sought.\n\nUpon receiving approval, three concurrent tasks begin: printing the packing slip, measuring the products, and attaching the shipping label to the package.  The printing of the invoice happens after the shipping label is attached. Once the packing slip is printed, the products are measured, and the invoice is printed, the items are loaded into the delivery vehicle.  Finally, a confirmation email is sent to the customer, marking the end of the process.\n",

Following this, two actions happen simultaneously: checking product availability in stock and recording which products were retrieved from storage.  Once the stock check is complete, the ordered products are requested from inventory.  Simultaneously, after recording the products taken from storage, quality checks are performed on those products.  When both the inventory request and the quality checks are finished, the items are securely packaged.  At the same time, approval is sought.\n\nAfter the approval is granted, three actions occur concurrently: printing the packing slip, measuring the products, and attaching the shipping label to the packaging.  The invoice is printed only after the shipping label is attached.  Finally, the items are loaded into the delivery vehicle. This loading happens after the packaging is complete, the invoice is printed, the packing slip is printed, and the products are measured.  Once the items are loaded, a confirmation email is sent to the customer, and the process ends.\n",

This leads to a point where several optimization paths can be explored simultaneously.  The user can note which steps can be automated, and at the same time, look to see if the process can be simplified.  If automating, the user then defines how long it takes to complete the process. If simplifying, the user examines potentially wasteful steps.  After completing either or both of these parallel paths, the user writes potential process improvements.  Following this, the user gets approval for the processing improvements.  Once approved, two parallel actions take place: defining what would make the improvements successful and using the updated process.  Both of these parallel actions lead to implementing the process changes.  The process ends once the changes are implemented.\n",

            "text": "The process begins with setting a target date for budget approval.  Following this, there are two simultaneous activities: evaluating any significant variances and reviewing the most recent budget.  Once both of these reviews are complete, the process moves forward with defining three to five goals and determining ways of achieving those goals, again concurrently.  These two activities both feed into prioritizing the chosen three to five goals.\n\nNext, there are two more parallel activities: calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost.  Both of these calculations are necessary to project the total annual income.  After projecting the income, the budget can be finalized and the financial data recorded in a budget spreadsheet. These two actions happen in parallel.  Once both are complete, the process splits again into two parallel paths: obtaining approval from top management and requesting approval from top management.\n\nIf top management approves the budget, the process continues with assigning management responsibilities and incorporating the budget into the master budget. These two actions happen in parallel.  Requesting approval from top management, regardless of the outcome, directly leads to the end of the process.  Similarly, once management responsibilities are assigned and the budget is incorporated into the master budget, the process concludes.\n",

After the target date is set, three paths can be followed concurrently: evaluating any significant variances, reviewing the most recent budget, and a combined path for defining and determining how to achieve goals.\n\nFor the goal-related path, three to five goals are defined, and simultaneously, ways of achieving those goals are determined.  Once the ways to achieve the goals are identified, those same three to five goals are then prioritized.\n\nThe results of the variance evaluation, budget review, and goal prioritization are then combined.  Following this combination, the total annual budget and the average monthly cost are calculated in parallel.  These two calculations are then used to project the total annual income.\n\nAfter the income projection, the budget is finalized and financial data is recorded in a budget spreadsheet. These two actions can happen concurrently.  Once both are complete, approval from top management is obtained, and simultaneously, a request for approval is sent to top management.  The process ends once both the approval is obtained and the request is sent.\n",

Following this, two actions occur simultaneously: evaluating any significant variances and reviewing the most recent budget. Once both of these reviews are complete, two additional actions happen concurrently: defining three to five goals and determining ways of achieving those goals.  The ways to achieve the goals are then used to prioritize the three to five goals previously defined.\n\nAfter the goals are prioritized, two more actions can occur simultaneously: calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost.  Both of these calculations feed into projecting the total annual income.  Based on the projected income, two final actions occur in parallel: finalizing the budget and recording the financial data in a budget spreadsheet.\n\nOnce the budget is finalized and the data is recorded, two actions are initiated simultaneously: obtaining approval from top management and requesting approval from top management. If approval is obtained from top management, then management responsibilities are assigned and the budget is incorporated into the master budget.  If approval is requested from top management, but not obtained, the process ends.  The process also ends once management responsibilities are assigned and the budget is incorporated into the master budget.\n",

Once the amendments are confirmed, a three-way match is double-checked.\n\nAfter the three-way match is verified, the process again splits into two parallel paths. One path involves storing the documents in the paid invoice file. The other path involves creating a voucher for the documents.  After the invoice is stored, another split occurs.  One path is to enter the invoice into the accounts payable account. The other is to stamp all documents.  Finally, after the invoice is entered, the documents are stamped, the voucher is created, and any errors have been reported, the process ends.\n",

The first path involves getting approval for the first draft of a plan. The second path focuses on researching campaign ideas.  The third path involves three simultaneous activities: confirming a questionnaire is complete, updating a project management profile, and updating the client's CRM.\n\nOnce the first draft is approved, this path is complete.  The research campaign ideas path leads into another set of parallel activities: confirming the questionnaire is complete, updating the project management profile, and updating the client's CRM.  These three activities must all be finished before moving forward.  Similarly, the three activities initiated in the first parallel split (confirming the questionnaire, updating the project management profile, and updating the client's CRM) must also be complete.\n\nAfter the project management profile is updated, two more parallel activities begin: scheduling future calls and creating the first draft of the marketing plan.  These two activities, along with the completion of the \"get approval for first draft\" path, the \"research campaign ideas\" path, and the other parallel activities (confirming the questionnaire, updating client's CRM) must all be finished.\n\nOnce all these parallel paths converge, two final parallel activities take place: informing the client of the project start and assigning work to the team.  After both these activities are complete, changes are made based on a follow-up call.  Finally, after incorporating these changes, the process ends.\n",

After this confirmation, three tasks happen concurrently: getting approval for the first draft, researching campaign ideas, and updating the client's CRM.  While the first draft approval process runs independently, the research campaign ideas task kicks off another set of three parallel tasks: confirming the questionnaire is complete, updating the project management profile, and updating the client's CRM.  Once all three of these are finished, they converge.  Similarly, once the project management profile is updated, two more parallel tasks begin: scheduling future calls and creating the first draft of the marketing plan. These two tasks, along with the approval for the first draft, the research of campaign ideas, and confirming the questionnaire, must all be complete before the process can move forward.  Once these five parallel streams of work are finished, two final parallel tasks begin: informing the client of the project start and assigning work to the team.  After both of these are complete, changes are made based on a follow-up call.  The entire process ends once these changes are implemented.\n",

The first path involves getting approval for the first draft of the marketing plan. The second path focuses on researching campaign ideas.  The third path involves three simultaneous activities: confirming the questionnaire is complete, updating the project management profile, and updating the client's CRM.\n\nOnce the first draft approval is obtained, this path is put on hold until the other parallel paths are completed.  The research campaign ideas path leads to another set of parallel activities: confirming the questionnaire is complete, updating the project management profile, and updating the client's CRM.  The questionnaire confirmation task converges with the identical task from the previous parallel path.  Simultaneously, the project management profile update leads to scheduling future calls and creating the first draft of the marketing plan, which are done in parallel.  These two tasks, along with the client's CRM update from the earlier parallel path, must all be completed.\n\nAll the different branches of work now converge.  Once all the parallel paths are complete, two actions occur simultaneously: informing the client of the project start and assigning work to the team.  Finally, changes are made based on the follow-up call resulting from informing the client and assigning work.  This marks the end of the process.\n",

After all three of these parallel actions are finished, the lender begins the underwriting process.\n\nThe underwriting process then triggers three more parallel actions: the lender may reduce the loan amount, approve the loan application, or change the interest rate.

The first track involves confirming if the process requires optimization. The second parallel track focuses on identifying the process's components. Once both of these tasks are complete, another set of parallel tracks start. One track involves defining how long the process takes to complete, while the other looks to see if the process can be simplified.  After both of these tasks are finished, the next step is to assess if any steps are confusing.  Following this assessment, the potential process improvements are written down.\n\nNext, approval for these improvements is sought.  Once approved, three parallel activities commence: using the updated process, defining what would make the improvements successful, and determining what improvements should go forward.  After the updated process is used and the success criteria are defined, two more parallel activities begin: updating the process documents and adding feedback on the updated process.  Concurrently, after determining which improvements should move forward, the next step is to choose who will test the updated process.  Once the process documents are updated, feedback is added, and testers are chosen, three parallel activities begin: determining how the process will be monitored, scheduling the next process review and optimization, and implementing the process changes.  Finally, after the process is monitored, the next review is scheduled, and the changes are implemented, the process ends.\n",

Following this, there are two simultaneous paths: confirming if the process needs optimization and identifying the process's components.  Both of these paths eventually converge, leading to two more parallel tasks: defining how long the process takes and looking to see if it can be simplified.  If the process is deemed to need simplification, the next step is to assess if any steps are confusing. Regardless of whether simplification is needed or any steps are confusing, the next step is to write potential process improvements.\n\nAfter documenting potential improvements, the next step is getting approval for those improvements.  Once approved, three parallel paths emerge: using the updated process, defining what would make the improvements successful, and determining which improvements should move forward.  The paths of defining success metrics and determining which improvements to implement both converge to choosing who will test the updated process.\n\nUsing the updated process leads to two more parallel tasks: updating the process documents and adding feedback on the updated process.  Meanwhile, after choosing who will test the updated process, three parallel paths emerge: determining how the process will be monitored, scheduling the next process review and optimization, and implementing the process changes.  Finally, all of these paths converge, marking the end of the process.\n",

Following this, there are three paths that can be followed concurrently: confirming if the process needs optimization, identifying process components, or both.  These paths converge, and regardless of which path or paths were followed, the time taken is defined and the process is reviewed to see if it can be simplified.\n\nIf simplification is possible, the next step is to assess if any steps are confusing.  This leads to writing potential process improvements, which then require approval.\n\nOnce approved, the updated process is used, and simultaneously, success metrics for the improvements are defined and future improvements are determined.  Using the updated process leads to updating process documents and adding feedback on the updated process.\n\nConcurrently with defining future improvements, the next step is to choose who will test the new process.  After this selection, three parallel actions occur: determining how the process will be monitored, scheduling the next process review and optimization, and implementing the process changes.  Once all three of these parallel actions are complete, the process ends.\n",

Following the introduction, two paths begin concurrently: preparing the employee's workstation and preparing their benefits package.  Once the workstation is ready, the employee discusses their role, goals, and projects with their supervisor.  Separately, once the benefits package is prepared, three more parallel tasks begin: creating the employee's accounts, assigning required reading materials, and preparing the necessary paperwork.\n\nAfter the accounts are created, three more parallel tasks are initiated: preparing employee paperwork, providing a job description with responsibilities, and getting approval for the onboarding process.  These tasks, along with the discussion with the supervisor and the assignment of reading materials, all converge.  Once all of these pre-onboarding tasks are complete, three more parallel tasks begin: taking the new employee out to lunch, assigning training materials, and inducting them into the company culture.\n\nWhen these three tasks are finished, along with getting final approval and checking the paperwork, two final parallel tasks are initiated: assigning the first project and checking the paperwork.  The process concludes after the first project is assigned, final approval is received, and the paperwork is checked.  The entire onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days.\n",

The new employee's workstation is prepared, while at the same time, benefits packages are put together and initial paperwork is started.  \n\nOnce the workstation is ready, the supervisor sits down with the new employee to discuss their role, goals, and projects.  \n\nAs the benefits package is finalized, account creation and the assignment of required reading materials can begin.  These two tasks, along with preparing the employee paperwork and providing a job description, can all happen simultaneously.  Once these are complete, they all feed into a point where approval is needed.  After this approval, the new employee is taken to lunch, given training materials, and inducted into the company culture. These three actions happen at the same time.\n\nFollowing lunch, training, and company culture induction, the first project is assigned.  Simultaneously, paperwork is checked and approval is sought again (potentially for the project).  Once the first project is assigned, the onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days.  After the paperwork is checked, the new employee is encouraged to interact with their team.  The process ends after the 60-day review and team interaction encouragement are complete.\n",

The new employee's workstation is prepared, and simultaneously, their benefits package is put together.  Once the benefits package is ready, accounts are created for the new employee.  This leads to preparing the employee's paperwork, providing a job description, and getting necessary approvals.  Concurrently, the new employee is introduced to their supervisor to discuss their role, goals, and projects.  After the discussion with the supervisor and the benefits package is ready, required reading materials are assigned. Once the introductions are made, the workstation is prepared, and the reading materials are assigned, the new employee is taken out to lunch, given training materials, and inducted into the company culture.  While these are happening, approvals are also being sought. After lunch, training, company culture induction, and approvals are complete, the new employee is assigned their first project and their paperwork is checked. Finally, after the first project is assigned and the paperwork is checked, the onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days, and the new employee is encouraged to interact with their team.  The process ends after the review and encouragement for social interaction.\n",

Once both the credit check (if performed) and application process (if performed) are complete, two actions occur simultaneously: generating an invoice in accounting software and sending the invoice. After both these actions are finished, monthly contact with the client is established.

After the quality check, the system prints the packing slip and the invoice.\n\nThe printing of the packing slip triggers a set of tasks that can happen in any order or even simultaneously: getting approval, packaging the items, and measuring the products.  As each of these tasks are completed, they loop back to allow for any remaining tasks in this set to be finished. Once all three are complete, the process continues with loading the items into the delivery vehicle.  In parallel to this packaging and loading process, arranging the delivery and examining other orders for delivery overlaps also occur.\n\nFinally, once the items are loaded, the delivery is arranged, any delivery overlaps are examined, and the invoice is printed, a confirmation email is sent to the customer, marking the end of the process.\n",

Based on the approval status, three paths can be taken simultaneously or individually: laying out a timeline, setting a budget, and stating the available resources.  These three paths converge when drawing up the project plan.  Regardless of whether any, all, or some of the three preceding steps were taken, the project plan is drawn up. After the project plan is complete, a kickoff meeting is held.  Following the kickoff meeting, two parallel paths can be pursued simultaneously or individually: recording KPIs and keeping communication open.  Finally, after both recording KPIs and communication are addressed, the project is completed, marking the end of the process.\n",

If approved, the next steps happen in parallel: a timeline is laid out, a budget is set, and available resources are stated.  While the resources are being stated, the timeline and budget setting efforts converge into the drawing up of a project plan.  Regardless of when the resource statement is finished, the project plan cannot be completed until both budget and timeline are finalized. Once the project plan is ready, a kickoff meeting is held. After the kickoff meeting, KPIs are recorded.  Following the recording of KPIs, communication is maintained. Finally, the project is completed, marking the end of the process.\n",

Regardless of which of these simultaneous paths are taken, they all converge to the next step: drawing up a project plan.  After the project plan is complete, a kickoff meeting takes place.  Once the kickoff meeting is finished, two final actions occur in parallel: recording KPIs and keeping communication flowing.  Both of these activities lead to the final step: ensuring the project is completed, which marks the end of the process.\n",

            "text": "The process begins with learning how to identify future failures.  After this initial step, three paths can be followed concurrently: specifying product market share, making plans for future products, and a combined review of several business aspects.\n\nThe combined review starts by reviewing the number of employees and the business plan.  Following the business plan review, three more reviews happen concurrently: employee enthusiasm, team chemistry, and expertise.  After the review of team chemistry is complete, the analysis of the competition's reputation begins, alongside the review of employee expertise. These two reviews feed into a check of the company's insurance.\n\nSimultaneously with the enthusiasm, chemistry, and expertise reviews, the review of the business plan also leads to another set of concurrent reviews: employee salary and benefits, company mission and direction, and the ability of the team leader.  Following the review of the team leader's abilities, two more concurrent reviews take place: the relationship to the founder and trustworthiness.\n\nThe reviews of product market share, future product plans, and number of employees all converge.  This convergence point then leads to a set of concurrent checks: cash flow, exit strategy, and current debt.  The exit strategy check leads to a review of income statements.\n\nFinally, the insurance check, the income statement review, and the reviews of founder relationship and trustworthiness all converge to mark the end of the process.\n",

            "text": "The process begins with learning how to identify future failures.  After this initial step, several paths can be taken concurrently: specifying product market share, making plans for future products, and a combined review process.\n\nThe combined review process involves reviewing the number of employees and the business plan.  The business plan review then branches into further concurrent reviews of enthusiasm, team chemistry, and expertise.  These three reviews feed into another combined review process focusing on employee salary and benefits, company mission and direction, and ability as a team leader.  The review of the team leader's abilities leads to a final set of concurrent reviews concerning the leader's relationship to the founder and their trustworthiness.\n\nMeanwhile, the specifying product market share and making future product plans paths both rejoin the initial combined review process where the number of employees is reviewed.  Similarly, the reviews of team chemistry and expertise rejoin the combined review process that evaluates employee salary, company mission, and team leadership abilities.\n\nAfter all these reviews are completed, they converge into a final combined review process that considers all the individual review outcomes along with the review of the number of employees, salary and benefits, company mission, the leader's relationship to the founder, and their trustworthiness. This leads to a parallel process of checking cash flow and the exit strategy.  Cash flow check leads to checking current debt, while the exit strategy check leads to reviewing income statements. Both checking current debt and reviewing income statements converge to analyze the competition's reputation.  Finally, the analysis of the competition's reputation leads to checking insurance, and the entire process concludes.\n",

Following this, there are two concurrent paths that can be taken, either calculating the grades or selecting the exam assignment. It's possible to do both, just one, or even neither.  Once both of these optional actions are completed (or skipped), any applicable changes are applied and the grades summary is reviewed.  These two actions happen one after the other.\n\nNext, the process splits into two parallel paths: exporting the course summary and exporting the final grades.  Both exports are performed simultaneously.  After both exports are finished, the process again forks into two parallel paths: getting approval signatures from the course director and sending the examiners the grade approval sheet.  These two actions also happen concurrently.  Finally, after both the signatures are obtained and the approval sheet is sent, the process ends.\n",

Following this, you have a choice of several promotional activities you can undertake.  One option is to reverse engineer your competition. Another is to incorporate deep-linking to your content from older posts.  These two activities can be done independently of each other.\n\nIf you choose to deep-link, the next step involves posting on Q&A sites and, at the same time, posting on related forums and groups. These two posting activities happen concurrently. Once both posting activities are complete, the process ends.  If you also chose to reverse engineer your competition, that activity happens independently and does not affect the other activities or the overall completion of the process.  The process concludes after all chosen paths are completed.\n",

After both lunch and the ceremony are complete, three tasks are performed concurrently: paperwork is checked, the first project is assigned, and expectations for the first month are explained.\n\nOnce these three tasks are finished, two final activities occur in parallel: check-in meetings are planned and the new team member is encouraged to socialize with the team.

After this, three actions happen in parallel: getting approval for a post-credit check review, sending a credit application form to the buyer, and generating the invoice.  Once the approval for the post-credit check is received and the credit application form is sent, the next step is to check the customer's payment terms.  At the same time as the payment terms are being checked, two other actions occur concurrently: generating the invoice and sending the invoice within the accounting software.  After the payment terms are checked, the invoice is generated, and the invoice is sent, the next action is to establish monthly contact with the client.  Following this client contact, two final actions happen simultaneously: recording the sales on credit of goods and recording the sales on credit of services.

Following this, three parallel actions take place: gathering the receiving report, double-checking a three-way match, and initiating the process of gathering the vendor's invoice.  Once the three-way match is complete, three additional parallel actions begin: gathering the vendor's invoice, confirming all documents have been amended, and reporting any errors to the relevant team member.  These six concurrent activities (gathering the receiving report, gathering the vendor's invoice, confirming document amendments, reporting errors, and the two stemming from the three-way match check) converge.  At this point, three final parallel actions are triggered: stamping all documents, scheduling the payment, and entering the invoice into the accounts payable account.  Once all three of these tasks are finished, the process ends.\n",

Regardless of whether the three-way match was necessary, the process continues with a check to see if all documents have been amended.  If so, the vendor's invoice is gathered and the confirmation of amendment is also noted. If not, any errors are reported to the relevant team member.  It's possible that both the vendor's invoice is gathered *and* errors are reported, or that neither of these happen, depending on the amendment status.  Once the receiving report is gathered, along with any combination of invoice gathering and error reporting, and the three-way match (if needed) is complete, the process converges.

After this, two actions happen at the same time: sending a credit application form to the buyer and running a credit check on the purchasing company.\n\nOnce the credit application form is sent, two more actions happen concurrently: getting approval for a post-credit check review and sending the buyer your terms of sale.  These two actions, along with the completed credit check, must all be finished before the process can move to checking the customer's payment terms and sending an invoice in your accounting software.\n\nThese two actions (checking payment terms and sending the invoice) must both be completed before three further actions can happen simultaneously: recording your activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with your client, and making a second physical copy.  After these three actions are finished, they feed back into the step where the customer payment terms are checked, the invoice is sent, and the subsequent actions are repeated.  This creates a loop where these steps are performed multiple times.\n\nSeparately, there are two final tasks that lead to the end of the process: recording sales on credit of goods and recording sales on credit of services.  These can happen independently of each other and any other step, but both must be completed before the entire process is considered finished.\n",

After this, two actions happen at the same time: sending a credit application form to the buyer and running a credit check on the purchasing company.\n\nOnce the credit application form is sent, two more actions happen concurrently: getting approval for a post-credit check review and sending the buyer your terms of sale.  These two actions, along with the completed credit check, must all be finished before checking the customer's payment terms.  Sending the invoice in your accounting software also happens concurrently with the credit check, approval, and sending the terms of sale, but it doesn't affect when the customer payment terms are checked.\n\nAfter the customer payment terms are checked and the invoice is sent, three actions happen simultaneously: recording your activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with your client, and making a second physical copy.\n\nFinally, after these three actions are complete, the sales on credit of goods and the sales on credit of services are recorded concurrently.  Once both of these recordings are finished, the process ends.\n",

Once both of these actions are complete, the process converges.\n\nThe user then records the customer's decision. Based on this decision, the process branches. If there are other decisions to be made, the user thanks the customer for their time and feedback. If there are no other decisions, the process skips directly to asking the customer if they have any other concerns.  Regardless of which path was taken, both converge at the point where the user asks if there are any other concerns.\n\nFinally, the user sends the learnings to the appropriate managers, and the process ends.\n",

Following the timeline layout, the kickoff meeting is held.  After the kickoff meeting, the KPIs are recorded. Once the approval is obtained, the value is worked out, the timeline is laid out, the kickoff meeting is held, and the KPIs are recorded, two parallel actions take place: project outcomes are evaluated and it is ensured that the project is completed.  After both the evaluation of project outcomes and the project completion are confirmed, contractors are terminated. The process ends after the termination of contractors.\n",

These include performing quality checks on the ordered items, checking if the products are in stock, and recording which products are being taken out of storage.\n\nIf the stock check reveals that the products are available, a request is sent to the inventory to retrieve the ordered items.  Once the items are retrieved, a packing slip is printed.  After the packing slip is printed, two processes run in parallel: examining other orders to see if there are any delivery overlaps and loading the items into the delivery vehicle.  The delivery is then arranged, taking into account any potential overlaps identified in the previous step.\n\nOnce the items are loaded and the delivery is arranged, and the quality checks and stock recording are complete, a confirmation email is sent to the customer.

If the products are available, two parallel actions are initiated: securely packaging the ordered items and printing the invoice.  After both packaging and invoice printing are finished, the process checks for any potential delivery overlaps with other orders.\n\nIf there are delivery overlaps, the system examines these overlaps to optimize the delivery schedule.

Following the introductions, the new employee receives a detailed job description outlining their responsibilities.  Next, the onboarding process diverges slightly.  The new employee may be taken out to lunch, provided with training materials, or both.  These activities can happen independently or concurrently.  Once both the lunch (if applicable) and training material distribution are complete, the process converges.  The new employee then receives an explanation of the expectations for their first month and is assigned their first project.  These two steps also happen concurrently.  Finally, check-in meetings are planned, and the onboarding process concludes.\n",

Following the introductions, the new employee receives a detailed job description outlining their responsibilities.  Next, the onboarding process diverges slightly.  The new employee might be taken out to lunch, and/or they are assigned training materials. These activities can happen together, separately, or even both might be skipped.  Once any lunch and training materials are addressed, the process converges.  At this point, two parallel tracks begin: explaining expectations for the following month and assigning the first project.  After both the expectations are explained and the first project is assigned, the final step is to plan check-in meetings, after which the onboarding process is complete.\n",

After the receiving report is created, three simultaneous actions take place: the vendor's invoice is gathered, a three-way match is double-checked, and any errors are reported to the relevant team member.  The three-way match involves gathering the receiving report. Once the vendor's invoice is gathered, the receiving report is gathered, and any errors have been reported, three further actions happen concurrently: the dates are checked to avoid penalty charges, the invoice is stored in the paid invoice file, and the invoice is entered into the accounts payable account.  After these three tasks are complete, two final actions occur simultaneously: a voucher is created for the documents, and all documents are stamped.  Once both the voucher is created and the documents are stamped, the payment is scheduled, and the process ends.\n",

Following this, three simultaneous actions take place: the vendor's invoice is gathered, a three-way match is double-checked, and the receiving report is gathered.  The double-checking of the three-way match can lead to reporting errors to the relevant team member.  Once the vendor's invoice, the three-way match check, and the receiving report gathering are complete, three more parallel actions are initiated: checking dates to avoid penalty charges, storing the invoice in the paid invoice file, and entering the invoice into the accounts payable account.  After the dates are checked, a voucher for the documents is created and simultaneously, all documents are stamped. Finally, the payment is scheduled, concluding the process.\n",

Once completed, two things happen at the same time: the applicant completes the loan application, and the credit department receives it. After both of these steps are finished, the credit department sends the application back to the applicant and simultaneously gives a written notice to the applicant.\n\nNext, two parallel processes start. The applicant begins the underwriting process, and the credit department checks the credit score and risk score.  After both are complete, the credit department can then either change the interest rate or approve the loan application. If the interest rate is changed, the loan amount is then reduced.  Regardless of whether the interest rate is changed or the loan is directly approved, the final step is the applicant receiving the loan funds, after which the process is complete.\n",

Following this, two actions happen concurrently: the applicant completes the loan application, and the credit department receives the application.  Once both of these tasks are finished, the process can proceed down one of two paths, or both.  The credit department might send the application back to the applicant, or they might give written notice to the applicant, or both actions might be taken.\n\nIf either sending back the application or giving written notice occurs, or if both occur, the next step is to begin the underwriting process and simultaneously check the credit score and risk score.  After both underwriting and score checking are complete, two things can happen independently: the interest rate might be changed, and the loan application might be approved.\n\nIf the interest rate is changed, the loan amount is then reduced.  Regardless of whether the interest rate is changed and the loan amount reduced, or if the loan is simply approved, the applicant receives the loan funds.  The process then ends.\n",

Simultaneously, in the other path, the user records whether the customer is willing to talk further.\n\nThe path involving the call confirmation continues independently. However, the \"willingness to talk\" path leads to a decision point. If the customer is willing to talk, the process merges with the call confirmation path. If not, the process proceeds directly to the next step.\n\nNow, both paths converge, and two actions happen in parallel: identifying the root cause(s) of the customer's problem and asking open-ended questions. Once both these tasks are complete, the user presents the customer with a special offer.\n\nAfter the offer is presented, two more parallel actions take place: thanking the customer for their time and feedback, and recording the customer's decision regarding the offer.  These parallel actions then converge.\n\nFinally, the process splits again into parallel paths.  The user asks if the customer has any other concerns.  Based on the customer's response, the user sends any important learnings from the conversation to the appropriate managers and notes down these learnings.  Once both these tasks are finished, the process ends.\n",

Following this, two actions happen in parallel: confirming the call date and time, and recording whether the customer is willing to talk. Once both of these are complete, the user proceeds to identify the root cause(s) of the customer's problem and simultaneously asks open-ended questions.  Both of these actions lead into presenting the customer with a special offer.  After the offer is presented, the user thanks the customer for their time and feedback and simultaneously records the customer's decision.  Both of these actions lead to asking if the customer has any other concerns. Finally, after addressing any remaining concerns, the user sends learnings to the appropriate managers and notes down important learnings from the conversation.  These two final actions happen in parallel and conclude the process.\n",

These three options don't have to happen in any particular order, and can even happen simultaneously.\n\nAfter posting on Q&A sites, the next step is to submit the content to link roundups.

After this, two actions happen at the same time: a credit application form is sent to the buyer, and a credit check is run on the purchasing company. Once both these actions are complete, the invoice is sent in the accounting software and, simultaneously, the customer's payment terms are checked.  After the invoice is sent and the payment terms are checked, two more parallel actions take place: a second physical copy of the invoice is made, and the activity is digitally recorded.  Finally, after both these recording actions are finished, the process splits based on the type of sale. If it's a service sale, the sales on credit of services are recorded. If it's a goods sale, the sales on credit of goods are recorded.  Both these paths lead to the end of the process.\n",

The second path is to attach the shipping label to the packaging.  \n\nIf approval is obtained, two parallel processes begin: measuring the products and packaging the items securely.  Once the products are measured, two more paths open up, and again, at least one must be chosen: printing the invoice and printing the packing slip.  These can also happen simultaneously.\n\nOnce the shipping label is attached, this converges with the packaged items, and four more paths open up, all of which can happen simultaneously: loading the items into the delivery vehicle, arranging the delivery, examining other orders for delivery overlaps, and sending a confirmation email to the customer.\n\nFinally, after the confirmation email is sent, the order is considered fulfilled, and the process ends.\n",

Following this, there's a point where several paths can be taken simultaneously or individually: getting approval and attaching the shipping label.\n\nOnce the payment is confirmed and the products are requested, approval may be needed depending on the specifics of the order.  At the same time, the shipping label can be attached to the packaging regardless of whether approval is necessary.  These two tasks can happen independently of each other.\n\nAfter approval is obtained, two tasks happen in parallel: measuring the products and packaging them securely.  These two actions are independent and can occur concurrently.\n\nAfter the products are measured, two more tasks can happen concurrently or individually: printing the invoice and printing the packing slip.  These tasks can happen independently of each other.\n\nOnce the invoice and packing slip are printed, and the items are packaged, three tasks can happen concurrently or individually: loading the items into the delivery vehicle, arranging the delivery, and examining other orders for delivery overlaps.  These tasks can happen independently of each other.\n\nFinally, after the shipping label is attached, the items are packaged, loaded, delivery is arranged, and other orders are checked for overlaps, a confirmation email is sent to the customer. This marks the end of the process.\n",

One path requires getting approval, while the other involves attaching a shipping label to the packaging.\n\nOnce approval is granted, the process forks again into two parallel actions: measuring the products and packaging them securely.  These two actions converge, and then the process branches, potentially executing two actions: printing the invoice and printing the packing slip.  It's important to note that either, both, or neither of these printing actions may occur.\n\nMeanwhile, after the shipping label is attached, the results of the measuring and packaging steps, along with the printing of the invoice and packing slip (if they occurred), are all brought together.  At this point, three actions happen concurrently: loading the items into the delivery vehicle, arranging the delivery, and examining other orders for potential delivery overlaps.\n\nFinally, after these three concurrent actions are complete, a confirmation email is sent to the customer, and the order is considered fulfilled.\n",

The application of changes feeds into the grade summary review.\n\nAfter the course and grade summaries are reviewed, three parallel processes begin: exporting the final grades, recalculating the grades (if necessary), and exporting the course summary.  These three processes converge, and two final parallel actions take place: sending the examiners the grade approval sheet and submitting the results to SSO.  Once both of these actions are complete, the process ends.\n",

Following this, there are two simultaneous paths: calculating the grades and applying special grades to individuals.  \n\nOnce the grades are calculated, two more parallel processes begin: preparing the grades for SSO and selecting the exam assignment. These two processes converge, leading to applying any changes and reviewing the course summary.  The special grades application also feeds into this convergence point.\n\nAfter the changes are applied and the course summary is reviewed, the grades summary is reviewed.  This then triggers three parallel actions: exporting the final grades, recalculating the grades, and exporting the course summary.\n\nThese three parallel actions then converge, leading to two final parallel actions: sending the examiners the grade approval sheet and submitting the results to SSO.  Once both of these actions are complete, the process ends.\n",

Once both these tasks are complete, the paths converge.\n\nThe process then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves determining ways of achieving goals, while the other focuses on defining three to five goals.  Regardless of the path taken, the next step is to prioritize those three to five goals.\n\nAfter prioritizing the goals, the process again forks into two parallel paths. One path involves listing all department expenses, and the other involves estimating the average monthly cost.  Once both tasks are completed, the next step is to project the total annual income.\n\nFollowing this, the process splits one last time into parallel paths. One path is to record the financial data in a budget spreadsheet, and the other is to finalize the budget.  After both these tasks are complete, the process splits again into parallel paths where a request for approval from top management is made, and approval from top management is obtained.

Once both of these reviews and evaluations are complete, the process splits again into two parallel paths.  The first path involves determining ways of achieving goals, while the second involves defining three to five goals.  After the goals are defined, they are then prioritized.  Once both the achievement methods are determined and the goals are prioritized, the process continues.\n\nNext, another set of parallel actions takes place: listing all department expenses and estimating the average monthly cost.  When both of these are finished, the total annual income is projected.  Following this projection, the process splits again.  Recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget happen concurrently.  Once both are complete, the process splits one last time.  A request for approval is sent to top management, and simultaneously, approval from top management is obtained.  After both the request and the obtaining of approval are finished, the process ends.\n",

Once both these reviews and evaluations are complete, two further actions are also done concurrently: determining ways of achieving goals and defining three to five goals.\n\nThe defined goals are then prioritized.  After prioritization, three tasks occur simultaneously: listing all department expenses, estimating the average monthly cost, and determining ways of achieving the goals.  Once the department expenses and average monthly costs are estimated, and the ways of achieving goals are determined, the total annual income is projected.\n\nProjecting the total annual income leads to two parallel actions: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget.  After both these tasks are finished, two final parallel actions take place: requesting approval from top management and obtaining that approval.

Following this, several actions can happen concurrently: the credit department receives the application, the borrower completes the application, and the lender may send the application back to the applicant with a request for more information, or give written notice to the applicant.  These concurrent actions don't depend on each other and can happen in any order or even simultaneously.\n\nAfter the application is either returned to the applicant or written notice is given, the underwriting process begins.  Simultaneously, the lender checks the applicant's credit score and risk score.  These two actions, beginning underwriting and checking credit/risk, also happen independently of each other.\n\nOnce both the underwriting process has begun and the credit/risk scores have been checked, the lender may choose to change the interest rate, reduce the loan amount, or both.  These actions, too, can happen concurrently or independently.\n\nFinally, after any potential interest rate changes and/or loan amount reductions, the loan funds are received by the borrower, concluding the loan application process.\n",

Following this, several actions can happen concurrently: the credit department receives the application, the borrower completes the loan application, or both the credit department receives the application *and* the borrower completes it.\n\nRegardless of whether these actions happen individually or together, two things occur next, in parallel: the application is sent back to the applicant, and a written notice is given to the applicant.  Once both of these steps are complete, the process continues down two separate paths simultaneously: the underwriting process begins, and the lender checks the credit score and risk score.\n\nAfter both the underwriting process and the credit check are finished, the lender may choose to change the interest rate, reduce the loan amount, or both.  Finally, regardless of whether the interest rate or loan amount is adjusted, the borrower receives the loan funds, and the process ends.\n",

After the assessment, the user writes potential process improvements and then gets approval for those improvements.

After both the invoice and payment terms are addressed, three more actions happen at the same time: recording your activity digitally, making a second physical copy, and establishing monthly contact with your client.

Concurrently, after a mentor is assigned, three more activities take place at the same time: expectations are explained, the company culture is introduced, and training materials are assigned.  Once these three activities are finished, they converge with the conclusion of the office tour and welcoming ceremony.  At this point, the paperwork is checked again, and approval is sought.  Once both are complete, the process moves to the next stage.\n\nNow, one of three things *might* happen: long-term goals are explained, the onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days, or the new employee is encouraged to interact with the team.  Any or all of these three activities may occur.  Regardless of which of these occur, the onboarding process then concludes.\n",

Once both these tasks are complete, another set of parallel tasks begins: touring the office, holding a welcoming ceremony, and assigning a mentor.  The mentor assignment kicks off another three parallel tasks: explaining expectations, inducting into company culture, and assigning training materials.  These three tasks need to be finished before rejoining the previous parallel track of touring the office and the welcoming ceremony. After these five tasks are completed (touring the office, welcoming ceremony, explaining expectations, company culture induction, and training material assignment), two more tasks happen in parallel: getting approval (again) and checking the paperwork.  Following this, the process takes several paths based on the results of the approval and paperwork check.  These paths include explaining long-term goals, reviewing the onboarding process over the next 60 days, and encouraging social interaction with the team.  Any combination of these three tasks may occur. Finally, once all chosen paths are complete, the onboarding process ends.\n",

Once the accounts are created, the office tour, welcoming ceremony, and assigning a mentor all occur simultaneously.  After a mentor is assigned, explaining expectations, inducting into company culture, and assigning training materials happen at the same time.  When these three tasks are complete, the new employee's paperwork is checked and their approval status is re-evaluated.  Once the paperwork is checked and approval is granted, the long-term goals are explained, the onboarding process is reviewed over the next 60 days, and the new employee is encouraged to interact with the team. These three final steps may happen in any order, or even simultaneously, and once they are all completed, the onboarding process ends.\n",

This initial check then splits the process into several parallel paths based on the potential ticket types: \"App Question,\" \"Technical Issue,\" \"Marketing/PR Question,\" \"Sales Question,\" and \"Mixed-type question.\"  So, while the ticket is being assessed for one type, it's simultaneously being considered for all other types.\n\nIf the ticket is identified as a \"Technical Issue,\" a further parallel check occurs to determine if it also falls under \"Sales Question\" or \"Mixed-type question.\"  This means a \"Technical Issue\" ticket could potentially be categorized as all three types at once.\n\nRegardless of the type, all paths eventually lead to a point where appropriate actions are chosen based on the identified ticket type(s).  This means that a ticket could trigger multiple actions. For example, a ticket identified as both \"Technical Issue\" and \"Sales Question\" would trigger actions relevant to both categories.\n\nFrom this point, three possible actions can be taken: \"Testing technical issues,\" \"Replicating the issue,\" and \"Responding to the ticket question.\"  These actions can occur independently of each other and in parallel, depending on the ticket's classification.  Once any of these actions are completed, the process ends.\n",

Following this, two actions happen concurrently: the applicant completes a loan application and the lender receives the application.  Once both these actions are finished, the lender checks the application for completeness and simultaneously gives written notice to the applicant.  After both the completeness check and the written notice are provided, the lender begins the underwriting process and concurrently checks the applicant's credit score and risk score.  The results of both the underwriting process and the credit/risk score check are used to determine if the loan amount needs to be reduced.  Finally, after the loan amount is potentially reduced, the applicant receives the loan funds, and the process ends.\n",

After both of these are complete, the customer is thanked for their time and feedback, and their final decision is recorded.

Simultaneously, the other two paths (confirming call time and willingness to talk) converge.  Once all three paths are complete, the user gives the customer a call, asks open-ended questions, summarizes why they want to leave, and identifies the root cause(s) of the problem.  These actions all happen concurrently.\n\nFollowing this, the user informs the customer of key metrics demonstrating value and presents them with a special offer. These two actions also occur simultaneously.  After both are completed, the user thanks the customer for their time and feedback, and records the customer's decision. These actions also happen concurrently.\n\nFinally, the user asks if the customer has any other concerns.

Based on these key points, several actions may happen concurrently or independently: sending an email, confirming a call date and time, and recording the customer's willingness to talk.\n\nAfter sending the email, two parallel actions occur: recording whether or not the customer responded and giving the customer a call.  Meanwhile, the information from confirming the call, recording willingness to talk, recording customer response, and giving the call are all gathered.  Once all of this information is collected, three actions happen in parallel: asking open-ended questions, summarizing why the customer wants to leave, and identifying the root cause(s) of the problem.\n\nFollowing these actions, two more parallel actions occur: informing the customer of key metrics demonstrating value and presenting them with a special offer.  After both of these are complete, the user thanks the customer for their time and feedback and records the customer's decision.  Finally, the user asks if the customer has any other concerns, sends the learnings to the appropriate managers, and the process ends.\n",

Once both of these are complete, the client is informed of the project start and work is assigned to the team. These two actions also happen concurrently.\n\nRegardless of whether the project management profile was updated, once the client has been informed of the project start and the work has been assigned, a follow-up call is conducted and any necessary changes based on that call are made.

Similarly, once the project management profile is updated, it also converges with the combined output of the scheduling and questionnaire tasks.\n\nThese three paths (research campaign ideas, updating the project management profile, and the combined scheduling/questionnaire tasks) all come together.  At this point, two more parallel paths begin: informing the client of the project start and assigning work to the team.  After both of these tasks are completed, they converge.\n\nFinally, a follow-up call is conducted and any necessary changes based on that call are made concurrently. Once both are finished, the process ends.\n",

On one path, the new employee is provided with a detailed job description outlining their responsibilities.  Simultaneously, on the other path, their workstation is being prepared.  Once both of these tasks are complete, the paths converge.\n\nNext, another set of parallel tasks begins.  A mentor is assigned to the new employee, and at the same time, they are taken out to lunch.  After both the mentor assignment and lunch are finished, the process moves forward.\n\nThe process then splits again into two parallel paths. One path involves getting approval for the next steps, while the other involves assigning the employee their first project.  Once the first project is assigned, the new employee is encouraged to interact socially with their team.  Separately, after approval is received, reading material for personal growth is provided to the employee.  The process converges after the reading material is given.\n\nFinally, the onboarding process concludes with a review of the entire experience over the next 60 days.\n",

Following this call, three tasks are performed concurrently: creating the first draft of the marketing plan, updating the project management profile, and scheduling future calls.\n\nOnce the first draft of the marketing plan is complete, it is submitted for approval.  At the same time, the project management profile update leads to researching campaign ideas.  These two tasks, along with the scheduling of future calls, are independent but must all be completed before moving forward.\n\nAfter these three parallel paths converge, the client is informed of the project start.  This notification then branches into two possible paths.  The client may request changes based on a follow-up call, leading to the task of making those changes.  Alternatively, or in addition to requesting changes, a post-onboarding survey is sent to the client.\n\nIf a survey is sent, a follow-up call is conducted based on the survey results.  Regardless of whether changes were requested and made, or a survey was sent and followed up on, the process concludes after the follow-up call or after the changes are implemented.  Both paths lead to the end of the process.\n",

After this, three tasks happen concurrently: getting approval for a post-credit check review, sending a credit application form to the buyer, and sending the buyer the terms of sale.  While the first two tasks proceed directly to the next step, sending the terms of sale is followed by running a credit check on the purchasing company. Once all four of these tasks are complete, the process moves forward.\n\nNext, three more tasks happen at the same time: generating an invoice, sending the invoice in accounting software, and checking customer payment terms.  After these three tasks are finished, the process continues.\n\nThe following step involves two tasks that may or may not both happen: recording the activity digitally and making a second physical copy.  If the digital record is created, then the next step is establishing monthly contact with the client.  Regardless of whether a physical copy is made, the process continues.\n\nFinally, after the client contact (if it occurred), there are two more tasks that may or may not both happen: recording the sales on credit of services and recording the sales on credit of goods.  Once these final recording tasks are complete (if they occur), the process ends.\n",

After this, three actions happen at the same time: getting approval for a post-credit check review, sending a credit application form to the buyer, and sending the buyer the terms of sale.  While the first two are underway, the terms of sale being sent triggers a credit check on the purchasing company. Once all four of these steps are complete, another three simultaneous actions begin: generating the invoice, sending the invoice in accounting software, and checking customer payment terms.\n\nWhen these three are finished, two more actions happen concurrently: recording the activity digitally and making a second physical copy.  The digital recording leads to establishing monthly contact with the client. Once both the physical copy and the client contact are complete, there's a point where the process could repeat itself, leading to the recording of sales on credit of services and the recording of sales on credit of goods.  Finally, after both sales are recorded, the process ends.\n",

While the three-way match is being checked, the person who reported errors also gathers the vendor's invoice.\n\nAfter the documents are amended, the three-way match is complete, and the vendor's invoice is gathered, the process reaches a decision point.

In the first, someone confirms that all documents have been amended.  Simultaneously, in the second parallel process, the Receiving Report is gathered.\n\nOnce the Receiving Report is gathered, two more parallel processes begin: reporting any errors to the relevant team member and double-checking a three-way match.  If errors are found, the next step is to gather the vendor's invoice.  Regardless of whether errors were found, both the three-way match check and the gathering of the vendor's invoice must be completed before the process can continue.\n\nAfter both of these parallel processes are finished, and all documents are confirmed as amended, the process converges.  At this point, a decision is made.  Based on this decision, the process either proceeds to storing the information in the Paid Invoice File or scheduling the payment.  After either of these final steps is completed, the process ends.\n",

One involves reporting any errors to the relevant team member.  The other involves someone double-checking a three-way match.  If errors were found, the vendor's invoice is gathered after the errors are reported.\n\nWhen the document confirmation, the three-way match, and the gathering of the vendor's invoice (if necessary) are all complete, these parallel processes converge.

Following this, several tasks happen at the same time: analyzing how the customer uses the product, determining ways to increase the product's value for them, and identifying key points of value.  While this is happening, the impact of the customer's cancellation is also quantified.\n\nOnce all of these parallel tasks are complete, two more tasks happen concurrently: confirming a call date and time with the customer, and actually giving them a call.  After the call, the outcome is recorded, noting whether the customer responded and if they were willing to talk. If the customer responded to the call, an email is sent to them.  Regardless of whether an email is sent, the process continues once the call is completed and the willingness to talk is recorded.\n\nNext, two more parallel tasks take place: summarizing why the customer wants to leave and asking them open-ended questions to understand their reasons better.  After these are done, three final parallel tasks occur: describing ideas to increase value, presenting a special offer to the customer, and informing them of key metrics demonstrating the product's value.\n\nOnce these three tasks are complete, the customer is thanked for their time and feedback, and their final decision is recorded.  Finally, the customer is asked if they have any other concerns, important learnings from the conversation are noted down, and the process ends.\n",

Following this, three actions are performed concurrently: analyzing how the customer uses the product, determining ways to increase product value for the customer, and identifying key points of value.\n\nOnce the analysis of product usage is complete, the impact of the customer's cancellation is quantified.  When all three parallel actions (analyzing product usage, determining ways to increase value, and identifying key points of value) are finished, two more actions happen simultaneously: confirming the date and time for a call with the customer, and actually giving them a call.\n\nAfter the call is scheduled, two tasks occur in parallel: recording whether or not the customer responded to the scheduling attempt, and recording if they are willing to talk.  Regardless of whether the customer responded to the call scheduling or their willingness to talk, an email is sent to them.\n\nAfter the email is sent, and after the actual call is completed, and after it's determined whether the customer is willing to talk, two actions happen concurrently: summarizing why the customer wants to leave, and asking them open-ended questions.\n\nOnce the open-ended questions are asked and the reasons for leaving are summarized, three actions are performed concurrently: describing ideas to increase value, presenting a special offer, and informing the customer of key metrics demonstrating value.\n\nAfter all three of these parallel actions are complete, the customer is thanked for their time and feedback.  This leads to recording the customer's final decision.  After the decision is recorded, the customer is asked if they have any other concerns. Finally, important learnings from the conversation are noted down, concluding the process.\n",

Once all three of these parallel tasks are complete, two more actions happen in parallel: exporting the final grades and exporting the course summary.  After both exports are finished, the grades are recalculated.  Next, the process splits based on certain conditions.  Either approval signatures are obtained from the course director, or the results are submitted to SSO, or both occur. If approval signatures are obtained, the process ends.

After this initial step, three parallel processes are initiated: specifying product market share, checking the startup's location, and conducting a SWOT analysis.  Checking the startup's location leads to making plans for future products.  Once the market share is specified, the SWOT analysis is complete, and future product plans are made, these three parallel processes converge.\n\nNext, three more processes begin, all running concurrently: reviewing the number of employees, reviewing the business plan, and reviewing the company's mission and direction.  Reviewing the number of employees leads to reviewing enthusiasm.  Reviewing the company mission and direction leads to reviewing trustworthiness and reviewing ability as a team leader.  When the business plan review, the enthusiasm review, and the team leader ability review are all finished, these three concurrent processes converge.  Simultaneously, the trustworthiness review and ability as a team leader review converge into reviewing team chemistry and reviewing expertise.\n\nFollowing this, team chemistry and expertise are reviewed concurrently. Once both reviews are complete, they converge, along with the converged processes from the previous step. This leads to checking the exit strategy and checking cash flow, which happen concurrently.  Once both are complete, they converge.\n\nFinally, analyzing the competition's reputation and knowing the exact competition happen in parallel.  Once both are finished, they converge into checking trademarks.  After the trademarks are checked, the process ends.\n",

After this is complete, three parallel paths are initiated: specifying product market share, checking the startup's location, and doing a SWOT analysis.  Checking the startup's location leads to making plans for future products. Once all three parallel paths (market share, location/future products, and SWOT analysis) are finished, the process moves forward.\n\nNext, one or more of the following actions are performed: reviewing the number of employees, reviewing the business plan, and reviewing the company mission and direction. Reviewing the number of employees leads to reviewing enthusiasm.  If the company mission and direction are reviewed, this triggers two more parallel paths: reviewing trustworthiness and reviewing ability as a team leader.  Reviewing trustworthiness leads to reviewing team chemistry and reviewing expertise.  These two reviews can happen in any order or even simultaneously.  Once both reviews are complete, along with reviewing ability as a team leader, the process continues.\n\nAt this point, one or more of the following are reviewed: team chemistry and expertise.  This leads to checking the exit strategy and checking the cash flow. These two checks can happen in any order or even simultaneously. Once both are complete, two parallel paths begin: analyzing the reputation of the competition and knowing the exact competition.  Once both of these are finished, the final step is checking trademarks.  After this is complete, the process ends.\n",

            "text": "The process begins with learning how to identify future failures.  After this initial step, three tasks are performed concurrently: specifying product market share, checking the startup's location, and conducting a SWOT analysis.  Once the startup's location is checked, plans for future products are made.  When all three parallel tasks (market share, location, and SWOT) are complete, the process proceeds.\n\nNext, three more tasks are handled simultaneously, but this time they are based on conditions: reviewing the number of employees, reviewing the business plan, and reviewing the company's mission and direction.  If the number of employees is reviewed, employee enthusiasm is then reviewed. If the company mission and direction are reviewed, two more tasks are done in parallel: reviewing trustworthiness and reviewing ability as a team leader.  If trustworthiness is reviewed, team chemistry and expertise are conditionally reviewed.  When both team chemistry and expertise reviews are finished (if applicable), they converge.  Similarly, when the parallel tasks of reviewing trustworthiness and team leader ability are complete, they also converge.\n\nThis leads to another set of parallel tasks: checking the exit strategy and checking cash flow.  Once both are done, the reputation of the competition is analyzed, followed by knowing the exact competition, and finally, checking trademarks.  The process ends after the trademark check.\n",

Based on this check, several paths can be taken.\n\nOne possibility is that the ticket is identified as a 'Marketing/PR Question'.  If so, it's further checked to see if it also qualifies as a 'Feature Request' or \"I'm not sure question\".\n\nIf the ticket is an \"I'm not sure question\", two parallel actions are initiated: determining if it's an 'App Question' and also if it's a 'Mixed-type question'.  Following this, three parallel actions are performed: replicating the issue, responding to the ticket question, and testing technical issues.  Once all three of these are complete, the process ends.\n\nAlternatively, if the initial ticket type check reveals it to be a 'Technical Issue', or a 'Feature Request', or any other type other than 'Marketing/PR Question', the process follows a different course.  The example provided doesn't detail these alternate paths, only showing the flow for 'Marketing/PR Question' and the subsequent \"I'm not sure question\" scenario.\n",

Following the introduction, two things happen at the same time: someone seeks approval and the approval status is identified.\n\nThe results of the approval request feed into a decision point.  Depending on the outcome, one or both of the following occur: the value of something is worked out, and the basic idea is recorded.  Regardless of which of these happen, they both converge to a single point.\n\nMeanwhile, the identification of the approval status leads to the following three actions happening concurrently: a project plan is drawn up, a budget is set, and available resources are stated.\n\nThe budget setting leads directly to laying out a timeline.  The project plan, the timeline, and the statement of resources all come together.  Once all three are complete, a kickoff meeting is held.\n\nFinally, after the kickoff meeting, the project is completed, marking the end of the process.\n",

The results of both these actions feed into a decision point.  Based on the outcome of the approval and the status, one or both of the following occur: the value is worked out and the basic idea is recorded.  Regardless of which of those happen, the process continues.\n\nNext, three tasks are performed concurrently: a project plan is drawn up, a budget is set, and available resources are stated.  The budget then informs the layout of a timeline.  Once the project plan, the timeline, and the statement of resources are complete, a kickoff meeting is held.\n\nAfter the kickoff meeting, two final parallel tasks take place: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are recorded and communication is maintained.  Both the KPIs and the communication feed into ensuring the project is completed.  Once the project is complete, the process ends.\n",

Once both the manager and the finance team have given their approvals, the supplier is informed that the order is ready for their review.  The supplier then provides their approval.  After the supplier's approval, the process splits based on certain conditions.  In some cases, the purchase order is recorded. In other cases, details are sent to the department. It's also possible that both actions occur.

Following this, two approvals are needed simultaneously: one from the manager and another from the finance team.  Once both the manager and the finance team have given their approvals, the supplier is informed that the order is ready for their review.  The supplier then provides their approval.  After the supplier's approval, two actions happen concurrently: the purchase order is formally recorded and the details of the order are sent to the relevant department.

Following the introduction, several tasks happen concurrently: the employee's workstation is prepared, and the necessary paperwork is completed.  Once both the workstation and paperwork are ready, the new employee is assigned a mentor, a welcoming ceremony is held, and training materials are provided.  These three tasks can happen in any order, but all must be completed before moving forward.\n\nAfter the mentor assignment, welcoming ceremony, and training materials are handled, two more tasks occur simultaneously: the employee is assigned their first project and given expectations for the first month.  Once both of these tasks are finished, the process splits based on certain conditions.  The employee is encouraged to interact socially with the team, and they may also be provided with reading material for personal growth.  These two tasks don't depend on each other and can happen independently.  Finally, check-in meetings are planned after the social interaction encouragement, while the onboarding process concludes after the personal growth reading material is provided (if any was given).  Both of these ultimately lead to the end of the onboarding process.\n",

Once both the workstation and paperwork are ready, three tasks occur simultaneously: a mentor is assigned, a welcoming ceremony is held, and training materials are provided.  After the mentor assignment, welcoming ceremony, and training materials are distributed, the new employee is assigned their first project and given expectations for the first month. These two actions can happen in any order, but both must be completed before the next steps.  Next, the employee is encouraged to interact with the team and is provided with personal growth reading material. These two actions can happen in either order or at the same time. Finally, check-in meetings are planned, and the onboarding process concludes.\n",

Following this, several actions happen concurrently: importing the gradebook, selecting the exam assignment, and applying special grades to individuals.  Once the exam assignment is selected and any special grades are applied, the process moves to calculating the grades.  Simultaneously, the gradebook import will be used to calculate the grades.  After the grades are calculated and the other parallel tasks are complete, the next step is to review the grades summary.\n\nAfter reviewing the summary, two more actions happen at the same time: exporting the course summary and exporting the final grades. The course summary export then leads to recalculating the grades.  Once the final grades are exported, this flows into the next stage.  The recalculated grades and the exported final grades both need to be completed before getting approval signatures from the course director.  At the same time as getting signatures, the results are submitted to SSO.  After the signatures are obtained, and after the results are submitted to SSO, the examiners are sent a grade approval sheet.  Once the grade approval sheet is sent, the process ends.\n",

The approval status then determines the next steps.  If approval is needed, the project's value is worked out and approval is sought.  Regardless of whether approval was needed, these three strands (recording the basic idea, working out the value, and getting approval) converge.\n\nOnce these are complete, three more parallel actions begin: laying out a timeline, drawing up a project plan, and setting a budget.  The project plan leads to stating the available resources.  The timeline, budget, and available resources then come together.  At this point, a kickoff meeting is held.\n\nAfter the kickoff meeting, KPIs are recorded.  This feeds back into the combined timeline, budget, and resources, creating a loop.  This loop continues until the project outcomes are evaluated and the project is completed.  Finally, contractors are terminated, and the process ends.\n",

The approval status then leads to one or both of the following: working out the value and getting approval.  Meanwhile, the recorded basic idea, the worked-out value, and the acquired approval all feed into the next stage.  At this stage, three actions happen concurrently: a timeline is laid out, a project plan is drawn up, and a budget is set.  The project plan leads to stating the available resources.  The timeline, budget, and available resources then converge, leading to a kickoff meeting.  After the kickoff meeting, KPIs are recorded.  The recording of KPIs leads to two simultaneous actions: evaluating project outcomes and ensuring the project is completed.  The evaluation of project outcomes leads to terminating contractors.  Finally, both the project completion and the termination of contractors signal the end of the process.\n",

Based on the identified approval status, there are two possible paths: either working out the value of the project or getting approval, or potentially both.  Regardless of which of these paths are taken, or if both are taken, they all converge.  At this point, three tasks occur concurrently: laying out a timeline, drawing up a project plan, and setting a budget.  The project plan leads to stating the available resources, while the timeline, budget, and available resources all come together for a kickoff meeting.  After the kickoff meeting, KPIs are recorded.  Finally, the project outcomes are evaluated and the project completion is ensured, both happening in parallel.  Terminating contractors and ending the project are the last steps, which can happen in either order, but both must be completed before the entire process is finished.\n",

Based on the specified details, three parallel paths can be initiated: reviewing team chemistry, reviewing ability as a team leader, and reviewing the number of employees.  It's important to note that any combination of these reviews can occur.\n\nOnce each of the chosen reviews is complete, they converge, and three more parallel checks begin: checking cash flow, checking income statements, and checking the exit strategy. Again, any combination of these checks can be performed.  The checking of income statements triggers two further parallel checks: checking current debt and checking quarterly projections.\n\nAfter both debt and projections are checked, they converge, leading to two more potential parallel analyses: projecting market share and analyzing the reputation of the competition.  Projecting market share leads to knowing the exact competition, while analyzing the reputation of the competition leads to analyzing the growth stage of the competition.  Finally, these two analyses converge, leading to two final parallel checks: checking insurance and checking patents.  Once both insurance and patents are checked, the process ends.\n",

Based on the specified details, three parallel paths can be taken: reviewing team chemistry, reviewing ability as a team leader, and reviewing the number of employees.  It's important to note that any combination of these reviews can occur.\n\nOnce each of the chosen reviews is complete, they converge, and the process continues with checking cash flow, checking income statements, and checking the exit strategy. Again, any combination of these checks can be performed.  The checking of income statements triggers two parallel actions: checking current debt and checking quarterly projections.\n\nAfter both the current debt and quarterly projections are checked, they converge, leading to projecting the market share and analyzing the reputation of the competition.  These two actions can happen in any combination.  Projecting the market share leads to knowing the exact competition, and analyzing the reputation of the competition leads to analyzing the growth stage of the competition.\n\nFinally, knowing the exact competition and analyzing the growth stage of the competition both converge. This leads to checking insurance and checking patents, again in any combination.  Once both insurance and patents are checked (if chosen), the process ends.\n",

Following this, three tasks occur concurrently: reviewing team chemistry, reviewing ability as a team leader, and reviewing the number of employees.\n\nAfter each of these three concurrent reviews are completed, the following financial checks are performed, potentially concurrently: checking cash flow, checking income statements, and checking the exit strategy.  The income statement check triggers two parallel processes: checking current debt and checking quarterly projections.  Once both debt and projections are checked, two more potentially concurrent tasks begin: projecting market share and analyzing the reputation of the competition.  Projecting market share leads to knowing the exact competition, while analyzing the reputation of the competition leads to analyzing the growth stage of the competition.  Finally, after both the exact competition and their growth stage are analyzed, two final potentially concurrent tasks are undertaken: checking insurance and checking patents.  Once both insurance and patents are checked, the process ends.\n",

Following this, two tasks happen in parallel: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once both these reviews and evaluations are complete, the process forks again into two parallel paths: prioritizing three to five goals and defining three to five goals.  After both prioritization and definition are finished, the process splits once more into parallel tasks: estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget.  The calculated total annual budget then leads to listing all department expenses.  Meanwhile, the estimated average monthly cost and the listed department expenses are both needed before projecting the total annual income.  After the total annual income is projected, two final parallel tasks occur: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget.  Both these tasks must be completed before the budget can be incorporated into the master budget.  Simultaneously, after the budget is finalized, management responsibilities are assigned.  Finally, after assigning responsibilities, approval from top management is requested, and once received, the budget preparation process is complete.\n",

Once both of these reviews and evaluations are complete, two more parallel actions take place: prioritizing three to five goals and defining those same three to five goals.\n\nAfter both the prioritization and definition are finished, the process splits again into two parallel paths: estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget.  The calculation of the total annual budget then leads to listing all department expenses.  Meanwhile, after the average monthly cost is estimated, this converges with the completed list of department expenses, and then the total annual income is projected.\n\nNext, two actions happen concurrently: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget.  Once both are done, the process forks again into two parallel paths: incorporating the data into the master budget and assigning management responsibilities.  Assigning management responsibilities leads to requesting approval from top management. Finally, after the master budget incorporation is complete, it converges with the top management approval, and the process ends.\n",

Following this, two tasks happen concurrently: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once both of these reviews are complete, the process moves to defining three to five goals and simultaneously prioritizing those same goals.  After both the definition and prioritization are finished, two more parallel tasks begin: estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget.  When the monthly cost is estimated, it feeds into listing all department expenses.  Simultaneously, once the annual budget is calculated, it triggers the next step.  The total annual budget calculation and the listing of department expenses both need to be completed before projecting the total annual income.  This projection then leads to two more parallel tasks: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget.  After both of these are done, the process splits again into incorporating the finalized budget into the master budget and assigning management responsibilities.  The assigned management responsibilities then lead to requesting approval from top management.  Finally, after the master budget incorporation and the management approval request are both completed, the budget preparation process ends.\n",

Based on their responses, a special offer is presented to them.  The customer's decision regarding the offer is then recorded.  After recording their decision, the customer is asked if they have any other concerns. Finally, any important learnings from the conversation are noted down, and the process ends.\n",

Following this, there's a choice to be made: either get approval for a post-credit check review or send a credit application form to the buyer. It's possible to do both, one, or the other. If a credit application is sent, the buyer is also sent the terms of sale.  After the terms of sale are sent (or if skipped), two tasks happen at the same time: checking customer payment terms and sending the invoice in the accounting software.\n\nOnce both the payment terms are checked and the invoice is sent, there are three possible actions that can be taken: record the activity digitally, establish monthly contact with the client, and make a second physical copy. Again, any combination of these actions can be performed.\n\nAfter any of these three actions are completed (or skipped), there's another choice: record the sales on credit of services or record the sales on credit of goods, or both.  Regardless of which of these final recording actions are taken, the process ends.  If approval for a post-credit check review was obtained initially, it leads directly to the step where activity is recorded digitally, monthly contact is established, and a second physical copy is made.\n",

Once both these parallel actions are complete, the user identifies the root cause(s) of the problem.  Then, the user describes their ideas to increase value.\n\nAt this point, the process branches based on the outcome of the previous steps. The user will *either* thank the customer for their time and feedback *or* record the customer's decision (or potentially both). Regardless of which of these actions occur, the process converges, and the user asks if the customer has any other concerns.\n\nFinally, two more actions happen in parallel: the learnings from the conversation are sent to the appropriate managers, and simultaneously, important learnings are noted down.
