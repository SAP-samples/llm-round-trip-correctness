The text below is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It begins when you confirm the received marketing and media resources. Once confirming the received marketing and media resources occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: updating client's CRM and confirming questionnaire is complete. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be informing client of project start and assigning work to the team, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending a post-onboarding survey and having a follow-up call. The process is now completed.
