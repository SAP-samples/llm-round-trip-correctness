The text below is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. When confirming the basic information is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming if the process requires optimization and identifying the process's components. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: defining how long it takes to complete the process, noting which steps can be automated, considering where bottlenecks occur. Once defining how long it takes to complete the process occurs, the next tasks should be assessing if any steps are confusing and looking to see if the process can be simplified, they should be done in parallel. After considering where bottlenecks occur, examining potentially wasteful steps needs to be done. Afterwards, writing the potential process improvements should be done. When writing the potential process improvements is completed, you need to get approval for processing improvements. When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, the next tasks should be determining what improvements should go forward and adding feedback on the updated process, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining how the process will be monitored and communicating the process changes. The process is now completed.
