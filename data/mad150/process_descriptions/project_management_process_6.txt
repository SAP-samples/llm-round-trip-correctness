The following description is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. Once making an introduction occurs, identifying the approval status should be taken into account. if all approved, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should record the basic idea. Then, you need to state the available resources. After stating the available resources, having a kickoff meeting needs to be done. Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: keeping communication and recording KPIs. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then evaluating project outcomes should be done. The process is now completed.
