The following description is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you set target date for approval. Once setting target date for approval occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: evaluating any significant variances and reviewing the most recent budget. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to prioritize three to five goals. After prioritizing three to five goals, you need to estimate the average monthly cost. When estimating the average monthly cost is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: listing all sources of income and projecting total annual income. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to record financial data in a budget spreadsheet. When recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet is completed, obtaining approval from top management needs to be done. The process is now completed.
