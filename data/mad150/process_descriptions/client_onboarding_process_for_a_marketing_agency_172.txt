After sending the contract to the client, the next tasks should be scheduling future calls, updating client's CRM and updating the project management profile, they should be done in parallel. After scheduling future calls, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval for the first draft, creating first draft of the marketing plan . After creating first draft of the marketing plan , researching the campaign ideas should be done. Once updating the project management profile occurs, you need to confirm questionnaire is complete. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then informing client of project start should be done.
