The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. When confirming the basic information is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming if the process requires optimization and identifying the process's components. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: assessing if any steps are confusing, considering where bottlenecks occur. After assessing if any steps are confusing, the next tasks should be defining how long it takes to complete the process and looking to see if the process can be simplified, they should be done in parallel. When considering where bottlenecks occur is completed, examining potentially wasteful steps needs to be done. Afterwards, writing the potential process improvements should be done. When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. After getting approval for processing improvements, one or more of the following paths should be executed: defining what would make the improvements successful, choosing who will test the updated process. When choosing who will test the updated process is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: updating the process documents, using the updated process. Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: communicating the process changes and implementing the process changes. The process is now completed.
