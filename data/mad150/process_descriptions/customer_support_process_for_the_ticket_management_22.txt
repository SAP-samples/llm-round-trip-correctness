The text below is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. Once checking the ticket type occurs, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'App Question', determining ticket type as 'Technical Issue' and determining ticket type as 'Marketing/PR Question'. After determining ticket type as 'Technical Issue', the next tasks should be determining ticket type as 'Sales Question' and determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question', they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: testing technical issues, replicating the issue, responsing ticket question. The process is now completed.
