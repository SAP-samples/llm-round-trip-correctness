The text below is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. When making an introduction is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: identifying the approval status and getting approval. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to draw up a project plan. Once drawing up a project plan occurs, having a kickoff meeting should be done. Once having a kickoff meeting occurs, the next tasks should be recording KPIs and keeping communication, they should be done in parallel.

When terminating contractors is completed, you need to evaluate project outcomes. The process is now completed.
