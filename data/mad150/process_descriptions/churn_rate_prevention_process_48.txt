The text below is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. Once recording basic details occurs, identifying key points of value needs to be done. Once identifying key points of value occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming call date and time and recording if they are willing to talk. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, asking open-ended questions. After that, presenting them with a special offer needs to be done. When presenting them with a special offer is completed, the next tasks should be thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customerâ€™s decision, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: sending learnings to appropriate managers and noting down important learnings from the conversation. The process is now completed.
