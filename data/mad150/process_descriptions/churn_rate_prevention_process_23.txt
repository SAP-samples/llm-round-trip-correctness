The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. Once recording basic details occurs, the next tasks should be analyzing how they use your product, determining ways to increase value and identifying key points of value, they should be done in parallel. When analyzing how they use your product is completed, you need to quantify the impact of cancellation. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be confirming call date and time and giving them a call, they should be done in parallel. After confirming call date and time, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording whether or not the customer responded, recording if they are willing to talk. Once recording whether or not the customer responded occurs, sending them an email needs to be done. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: summarizing why they want to leave, asking open-ended questions. Then, the next tasks should be describing your ideas to increase value, presenting them with a special offer and informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: thanking them for their time and feedback, recording the customerâ€™s decision. After that, you need to ask if they have any other concerns. Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, you need to note down important learnings from the conversation. The process is now completed.
