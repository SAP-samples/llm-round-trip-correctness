The following text is about the client onboarding process for a marketing agency. It starts with sending the contract to the client. After sending the contract to the client, one or more of the following paths should be executed: updating the project management profile, getting approval for the first draft. Afterwards, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assigning work to the team and informing client of project start. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then having a follow-up call needs to be done. The process is now completed.
