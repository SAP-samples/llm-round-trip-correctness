The following text is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. Once recording basic details occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: analyzing how they use your product and identifying key points of value. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then recording whether or not the customer responded needs to be done. When recording whether or not the customer responded is completed, asking open-ended questions needs to be done. When asking open-ended questions is completed, presenting them with a special offer needs to be done. Once presenting them with a special offer occurs, recording the customer’s decision needs to be done. When recording the customer’s decision is completed, asking if they have any other concerns needs to be done. When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, noting down important learnings from the conversation needs to be done. The process is now completed.
