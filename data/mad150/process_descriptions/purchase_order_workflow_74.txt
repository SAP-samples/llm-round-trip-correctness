The following description is about the purchase order workflow. It starts with creating the purchase requisition. When creating the purchase requisition is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval from finance team, getting approval from manager. After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: creating the purchase order and informing the supplier the order is ready for approval. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then getting approval from supplier needs to be done. Once getting approval from supplier occurs, the next tasks should be confirming the delivery date and sending details to the department, they should be done in parallel. The process is now completed.
