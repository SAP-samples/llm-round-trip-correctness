The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. Once confirming the basic information occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: confirming if the process requires optimization, identifying the process's components. Then, you need to assess if any steps are confusing. Once assessing if any steps are confusing occurs, you need to write the potential process improvements. After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, the next tasks should be determining what improvements should go forward and using the updated process, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then implementing the process changes needs to be done. The process is now completed.
