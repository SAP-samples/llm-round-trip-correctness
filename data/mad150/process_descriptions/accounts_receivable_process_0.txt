The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. Once recording the buyer's details occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval for post-credit check review, sending a credit application form to the buyer. Once sending a credit application form to the buyer occurs, sending the buyer your terms of sale should be done. After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking customer payment terms and sending the invoice in your accounting software. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording your activity digitally, establishing monthly contact with your client, making a second physical copy. Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of services, recording the sales on credit of goods. The process is now completed.
