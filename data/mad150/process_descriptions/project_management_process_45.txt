The following text is about the project management process. It begins when you make an introduction. After making an introduction, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording the basic idea and identifying the approval status. When identifying the approval status is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: working out its value, getting approval. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 3 parallel branches: laying out a timeline, drawing up a project plan and setting a budget. Once drawing up a project plan occurs, stating the available resources needs to be done. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to have a kickoff meeting. When having a kickoff meeting is completed, you need to record KPIs. After recording KPIs, the next tasks should be evaluating project outcomes and ensuring the project is completed, they should be done in parallel. Once evaluating project outcomes occurs, you need to terminate contractors. The process is now completed.
