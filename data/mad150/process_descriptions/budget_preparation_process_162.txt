The following text is about the budget preparation process. It starts with recording basic details. Once recording basic details occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: prioritizing three to five goals and defining three to five goals. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: estimating the average monthly cost and calculating the total annual budget. Once calculating the total annual budget occurs, listing all department expenses should be done. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then projecting total annual income should be done. After projecting total annual income, the next tasks should be recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: incorporating into the master budget and assigning management responsibilities. When assigning management responsibilities is completed, requesting approval from top management needs to be done. The process is now completed.
