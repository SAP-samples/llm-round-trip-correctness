The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. Once recording basic details occurs, determining ways to increase value should be done. Once determining ways to increase value occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording whether or not the customer responded, giving them a call, recording if they are willing to talk. Once recording whether or not the customer responded occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: confirming call date and time and sending them an email. After that, identifying the root cause(s) of the problem needs to be done. After identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, describing your ideas to increase value should be done. When describing your ideas to increase value is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the customerâ€™s decision, thanking them for their time and feedback. Afterwards, asking if they have any other concerns should be done. Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: noting down important learnings from the conversation and sending learnings to appropriate managers. The process is now completed.
