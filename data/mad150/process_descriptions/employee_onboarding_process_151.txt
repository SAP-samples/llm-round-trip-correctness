The text below is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. When making an introduction is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: preparing employee's workstation, preparing benefits package. When preparing employee's workstation is completed, discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor should be done. Once preparing benefits package occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: creating accounts, assigning required reading materials. Once creating accounts occurs, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: preparing employee paperwork, providing a job description with responsibilities and getting approval. Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: taking out to lunch, assigning training material, inducting into company culture. After that, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: assigning first project, getting approval and checking the paperwork. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing onboarding process over the next 60 days and encouraging them to socially interact with the team. The process is now completed.
