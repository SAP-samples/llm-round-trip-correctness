The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. After confirming the basic information, you need to assess the performance of the process. When assessing the performance of the process is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: considering where bottlenecks occur, looking to see if the process can be simplified, defining how long it takes to complete the process. After looking to see if the process can be simplified, one or more of the following paths should be executed: examining potentially wasteful steps, assessing if any steps are confusing. After that, you need to write the potential process improvements. After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: adding feedback on the updated process, updating the process documents. After that, one or more of the following paths should be executed: scheduling the next process review and optimization, determining how the process will be monitored, communicating the process changes. When communicating the process changes is completed, implementing the process changes needs to be done. The process is now completed.
