The text below is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It begins when you check the ticket type. When checking the ticket type is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ticket type as 'Feature Request', determining ticket type as 'App Question', determining ticket type as 'Sales Question'. When determining ticket type as 'Feature Request' is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'Simple Question' and determining ticket type as 'Billing Question'. After determining ticket type as 'Sales Question', one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ticket type as 'Marketing/PR Question', determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question', determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question'. Afterwards, one or more of the following paths should be executed: replicating the issue, responsing ticket question. Once responsing ticket question occurs, testing technical issues should be done. The process is now completed.
