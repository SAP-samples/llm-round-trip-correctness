The text below is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. After making an introduction, providing a job description with responsibilities needs to be done. After providing a job description with responsibilities, one or more of the following paths should be executed: taking out to lunch, assigning training material. After that, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: explaining expectations for the following month and assigning first project. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to plan check-in meetings. The process is now completed.
