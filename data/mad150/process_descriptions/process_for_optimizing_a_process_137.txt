The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. Once confirming the basic information occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: confirming if the process requires optimization, identifying the process's components. Then, one or more of the following paths should be executed: defining how long it takes to complete the process, looking to see if the process can be simplified. When looking to see if the process can be simplified is completed, you need to assess if any steps are confusing. Afterwards, you need to write the potential process improvements. After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: using the updated process, defining what would make the improvements successful, determining what improvements should go forward. Once using the updated process occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: updating the process documents, adding feedback on the updated process. When determining what improvements should go forward is completed, choosing who will test the updated process needs to be done. After that, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: determining how the process will be monitored, scheduling the next process review and optimization and implementing the process changes. The process is now completed.
