The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It starts with recording the buyer's details. After recording the buyer's details, you need to run a credit check on the purchasing company. Once running a credit check on the purchasing company occurs, generating the invoice should be done. Once generating the invoice occurs, the next tasks should be establishing monthly contact with your client and recording your activity digitally, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording the sales on credit of services and recording the sales on credit of goods. The process is now completed.
