The process at the FMCG Company begins when a request for sample products is made to the warehouse supervisor.

The supplier then provides the sample products, which are evaluated by the warehouse supervisor to determine if they meet the requirements.

If the sample meets the requirements, the product is selected, and a purchase order is sent.
If the sample does not meet the requirements, the product specifications are adjusted, and the process of providing sample products is repeated.

Once the purchase order is sent, the supplier checks the stock availability.

If the stock is available, the product is sent to the warehouse supervisor, who then receives the product.
If the stock is not available, the inventory is restocked, and the stock availability is checked again.

After receiving the product, the warehouse supervisor checks the products to ensure they match the order.

If the order and physical product match, payment authorization is sent, and the payment is processed.
If the order and physical product do not match, the missing products are requested, and the process of checking the stock availability is repeated.

Finally, after the payment is processed, the supplier is notified, marking the end of the process.
