The process begins with the project start.
The project team first conducts a cost calculation.
Following this, they create a planning document.
An event-based decision point then determines whether there are new customer requirements or if the requirements remain unchanged.
If new customer requirements are identified, the project team adjusts the prices accordingly.
If the requirements remain unchanged, the process continues without changes.


After the price adjustment, an exclusive decision point directs the flow towards documenting the payments.
Once the payment documentation is completed, the project is carried out.
During the project execution, if there is an escalation due to late payments, a subprocess is triggered to handle these late payments.
After handling the late payments, the situation is evaluated.


An exclusive decision point then assesses whether to continue the project.
If the decision is to continue, the project proceeds to the acceptance phase.
If the decision is not to continue, the project is terminated.


Upon project acceptance, the customer participates in the acceptance process.
Following the acceptance, the project team identifies potential follow-up projects.
Finally, the process concludes with the project closure.
Throughout the process, communication with the customer occurs to capture new requirements and to involve them in the project acceptance phase.
