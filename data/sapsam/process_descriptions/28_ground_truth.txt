The SoKnow process begins with the order intake in the development department.

Next, the requirements are described.

A workshop is then conducted, based on which a project sketch is created.

Once the project sketch is completed, the process waits for the appointment confirmation from the customer company.

Following this, a customer conversation is conducted, and then the specification sheet is written.

After the specification sheet is completed, it is sent to the customer.

The customer then provides feedback, which is received.

Subsequently, project and capacity planning are performed.

Next, standard open-source products are checked.

Based on this review, use cases are defined, and costs are calculated.

A decision is made whether to develop new products or use existing ones.

If existing products are selected, the knowledge management systems are adjusted (target process).

If new products are to be developed, the product is developed (target process).

After the adjustment of the knowledge management systems or the development of the new product, product acceptance is performed with the participation of the customer company.

Customer feedback is then obtained from the customer.

Finally, follow-up projects are identified, and the order is completed.
