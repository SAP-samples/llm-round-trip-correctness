The SoKnow process begins with managing personnel accounting in the personnel administration.

First, the payroll program is started.

Next, the automated debits are controlled.

Subsequently, the labor costs are calculated, salaries and social contributions are paid, and health insurance and additional costs are paid simultaneously.

Then, bonuses are entered, leading to the control of financial accounting.

After the financial accounting is controlled, the invoice is sent, which finally completes the personnel accounting.
