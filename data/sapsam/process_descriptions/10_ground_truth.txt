The process of the request fulfillment begins with the start event, after which the request is verified by the incident manager. 

Next, where the order is sent for request handling.

The order is then received by the 1st level support.

Following, the request is logged and categorized.

If the request is not authorized, the process returns to the first step.

If the request is authorized, the request monitoring and escalation is done by the incident manager and 1st level support.

Simultaneously, the model execution is requested by the service request fulfillment group and 1st level support.

These tasks are then merged back into a single flow.

Following the merge, the closure and evaluation is requested.

After the closure and evaluation are requested, it is checked if there was a problem with the request processing or the request record.

If there was no problem, the process moves to request fulfillment support, leading to a successful end of the process.

If there was a problem, the incident manager is contacted about the problem, and the process ends.
