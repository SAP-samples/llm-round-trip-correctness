The process begins with the receipt of an application by the HR department of ACME AG.

After receiving the application, an acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the applicant.

The next step involves checking the applicant, after which the HR manager determines the application status.

If the application status is rejected, a rejection is sent to the applicant, and the process ends with the rejection of the applicant.

If the application is accepted, the HR department sends an invitation to a job interview to the applicant.

Subsequently, the employment contract is prepared.

The job interview is then conducted.

After the interview, it is determined whether the applicant is suitable.

If the applicant is not suitable, a rejection is sent to the applicant, and the process ends with the rejection of the applicant.

If the applicant is deemed suitable, an employment contract is sent to the applicant.

The process then waits for the signed employment contract to be received.

Once the signed contract is received, the process concludes with the availability of the signed employment contract.
