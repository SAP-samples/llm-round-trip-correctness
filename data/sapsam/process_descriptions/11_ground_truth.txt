The process at AO-Software begins with the program start in the UI selection.

Then, the program starts for the player.

Once the program has started, the user is asked in the UI selection if they want to start the tutorial.

If the user chooses No, they begin with the standard key assignment.

If the user chooses Yes, they start a tutorial on the controller functions.

After completing the introduction, the player can choose to continue a game, load a saved game, start a new game, or access the game settings.

If the user decides to continue a game, the game resumes from where it was last ended.

If the user decides to load a saved game, the saved game data is retrieved, and the game continues from the saved point.

If the user decides to start with the standard key assignment, the game proceeds to the next step.

If the user selects the tutorial, they are guided through the tutorial on the controller functions.

After the tutorial, the user is asked if they want to start the game with the standard key assignment.

If they do not choose this, the process returns to the menu selection.

If they decide to start the game, the game proceeds to the next step.

Once the game starts, the system generates ambient noise and plays background music.

These tasks are executed in parallel.

After the ambient noise and background music are set up, the game is loaded.

Once the game is loaded, the system prompts the user for input.

After the user provides input, the game begins, and the process ends.
