First, the HR clerk retrieves the requirement profile.

Next, the job posting is retrieved.

Then, a co-signature note is created and forwarded.

The section manager reviews the note and decides if there are any comments.

If there are comments, the note is returned to the clerk, who creates and forwards a new co-signature note.

If the section manager has no comments, the note is forwarded to the department head for another review.

If the department head has no comments, the process ends.

If the department head has comments, the note is sent back to the section manager, who creates and forwards a new co-signature note.

The process ends when there are no further comments from the department head.
