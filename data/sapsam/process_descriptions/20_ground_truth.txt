The process begins when the customer wants to resolve an issue through customer service.

The customer recognizes the problem and contacts customer service.

The customer then describes the problem.

Next, the consultation team identifies the problem and finds a suitable solution.

This solution is described by the consultation team, and the problem is fixed by the customer.

Subsequently, it is checked whether the solution is found to be helpful.

If the solution is found to be helpful, it is implemented, and the process ends with the problem being resolved.

If the solution is not found to be helpful, a new solution is requested.

If this new solution is also not helpful, further solutions are suggested by the consultation team.

Finally, the process ends with the problem being resolved.
