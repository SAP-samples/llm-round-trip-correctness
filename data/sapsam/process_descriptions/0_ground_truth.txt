The process begins with the receipt of an application from the applicant in the ACME AG's Human Resources Department.

Upon receiving the application, a receipt confirmation is sent to the applicant.

The next step involves verifying the applicant, after which the application status is determined by the Head of Human Resources.

If the application is rejected, a rejection is sent to the applicant, and the process ends with the applicant being rejected.

If the application is accepted, an invitation to a job interview is sent to the applicant by the Human Resources Department.

Following this, the employment agreement is prepared.

The job interview is then carried out.

After the interview, it is determined whether the applicant is suitable.

If the applicant is not suitable, a rejection is sent to the applicant, and the process ends with the applicant being rejected.

If the applicant is deemed suitable, an employment contract is sent to the applicant.

The process then waits for the receipt of the signed employment contract.

Once the signed contract is received, the process concludes with the presence of the signed employment contract.
