The process at the DLL begins is started by the risk manager.

The risk manager initiates the process by performing a BKR check and a Jane Doe check in parallel.

If both assessments are accepted, the process continues with a credibility check.

If the credibility check is confirmed, the senior risk manager reviews the credibility assessment.

If the assessment is accepted, the process moves forward; otherwise, a rejection letter is sent to the client by the administrator, and the process ends.

If the credibility assessment is accepted, the customer relation team calls the client to complement information.

If the client picks up the call, the process  proceeds to create a loan offer. 
If the client does not pick up the call, the customer relation team waits one hour to and calls again until the customer picks up the call.
If the client picks up the call the process continues as described above.

After creating the loan offer, the loan offer is checked and then send to the client.

The process waits for the client to accept the offer.
If the offer is accepted, a welcome letter is sent by the administrator and the loan application is activated by the finance department.
The finance team then validates the loan activation and executes the initial payment.
Finally, the documents are returned to the client by the administrator, and the process ends.

If the client does not accept the offer within one our, the client is reminded again.
If the client accepts the offer the process continues as described above.
