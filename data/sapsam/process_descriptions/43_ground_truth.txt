The process for the driller begins with an order placed by the customer.

Subsequently, the customer issues the order.

Next, Jane Doe checks the feasibility of the order.

If the order is not feasible, the process is aborted through escalation.

If the order is feasible, it is checked whether an offer is available or if it is a repeat order.

If not, a price calculation is performed, and an offer is created and sent.

After a waiting period, it is checked whether the offer has been accepted.

If the offer is not accepted, the customer is informed that no order confirmation will be issued.

If the offer is accepted, the order is created and entered into production planning.

If an offer is available or it is a repeat order, the order is directly created and entered into production planning.

Finally, the order confirmation is sent, and the process ends with the dispatch of the order confirmation.
