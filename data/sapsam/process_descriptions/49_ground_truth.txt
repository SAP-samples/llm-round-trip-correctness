The process begins with the customer placing an order for food to a waiter. 

The order is communicated to the waiter.

The waiter then sents the order to the sous chef in the kitchen.

The sous chef manages the order of cooking and then passes the task to the chef, who starts cooking the food.

Once the cooking is done, the chef sends the food to the sous chef for checking.

The sous chef checks the food and then calls the waiter to grab the food.

The waiter then sends and communicates the food to the customer.

The customer receives the food and enjoys it.

Finally, the process ends.
