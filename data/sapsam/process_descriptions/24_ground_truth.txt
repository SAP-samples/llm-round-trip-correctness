The SoKnow process begins when the marketing department identifies that the existing website is outdated.

First, the marketing department analyzes the current content.

Next, the development department reviews this content.

Subsequently, the development department designs new content and updates existing content.

Once the new content is designed and the existing content is updated, the content is permanently updated, and the process ends with the website being up-to-date.

Simultaneously, the marketing department evaluates the content.

Both tasks are carried out in parallel.

If the content is positively evaluated, management is informed, and the process ends with the website currently needing no improvements.

If the evaluation is negative, the process is repeated starting from the review of the current content.
