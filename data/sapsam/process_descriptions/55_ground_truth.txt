The process for viticulture in outdoor operations begins when a field employee completes a task.

Next, it is decided whether information needs to be passed on.

If no, the information is not passed on.

If yes, the information is passed on and subsequently documented.

In both cases, the technical contact Jane Doe is then contacted.

If she is reachable, the completion report is submitted, and the process ends with the submission of the completion report.

If Jane Doe is not reachable, the completion report cannot be submitted, and attempts to reach her are repeated.
