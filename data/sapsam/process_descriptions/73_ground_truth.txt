The loan process begins when a user comes to the library.

First, the user is logged in.

Next, the user's request is determined.

If the user wants to extend media, the process for extending media is initiated.

If yes, the process ends with the confirmation that the media has been extended.

If no, the process concludes with the return of the medium.

If the user wants to borrow a medium, they first select the desired medium.

Then, the medium is searched in the database.

If the medium is available, the user is identified.

After that, the medium is lent, and the process ends.

If the medium is not available, a corresponding message is sent to the library user who does not belong to HTW.

If the user wants to reserve the medium, the loan receives a confirmation, the reservation process is started, and the process ends.

If the loan receives a rejection, the lending process is aborted, and the process ends.
