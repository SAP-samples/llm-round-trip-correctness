The process begins when a sales enquiry from a customer is received by Accentis.

Depending on whether the customer is inbound or outbound, either a contact is created or the enquiry is updated.

Upon receiving the sales enquiry request, the enquiry is created.

If a contact is created, the process moves to an exclusive decision point.

If the enquiry is updated, it also moves to the same decision point.

Next, the price is qualified as OK and there is interest and the customer approval ist sent.

Then the customer approval is received back by Accentis.

If the price is not approved, the enquiry status is updated to reflect that the client does not approve, and the process ends there.

If the price is approved, the process moves to the task of creating a quote.

Once the quote is created, a qualified requirements analysis is conducted.

Following the requirements analysis, the enquiry status is updated again.

After updating the enquiry status, a job is created, and the process ends with the job creation.
