The process at SoKnow begins when a conflict occurs with an employee.

The employee then seeks out the mediator.

Next, the HR department listens to the employee and schedules an appointment.

The employee attends the appointment and describes the conflict.

Subsequently, a solution for the conflict is sought.

It is then checked whether the conflict is resolved.

If the conflict is not resolved, a new appointment is scheduled, and the process starts over with finding a conflict resolution.

If the conflict is resolved, the process ends with the conflict being resolved.
