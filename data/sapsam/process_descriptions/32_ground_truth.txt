The department's process begins with a doctor planning a discharge.

First, the doctor sets the discharge date.

Next, the further course of action is discussed with the patient and their relatives.

Simultaneously, the medical care needs are determined.

At the same time, the nursing care needs are assessed by the nursing staff.

Subsequently, the doctor's letter is created.

After discussing the further course with the patient and their relatives, determining the medical care needs, and assessing the nursing care needs, the supply facility is defined.

Then, the doctor's letter is created in parallel, and it is checked whether social services are required.

If social services are required, further care services are initiated, and the discharge documentation is created.

If social services are not required, the discharge documentation is created directly.

After the doctor's letter and the discharge documentation are created, advanced tasks for discharge are carried out, and the process ends with the discharge.
