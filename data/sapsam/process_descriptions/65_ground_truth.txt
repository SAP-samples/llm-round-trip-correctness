The process at SoKnow begins when the marketing department identifies that the existing corporate designs are outdated.

Subsequently, the marketing department conducts a brainstorming session.

After the brainstorming, a new element is designed by the designers.

Next, the design is reviewed.

If the design is satisfactory, templates are created.

These templates are then reviewed by the marketing department.

If the templates are satisfactory, communication with management is conducted.

If management also finds the templates satisfactory, the new corporate designs are used.

If the templates are not satisfactory, the process is reset, and the designers revise the design again.

This cycle repeats until the templates and designs meet the requirements and the new corporate designs can be used.
