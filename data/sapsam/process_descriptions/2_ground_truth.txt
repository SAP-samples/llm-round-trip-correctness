The process begins when parts are required in a department at the ACME AG.

The first step is check if the parts are in stock.

If the parts are in stock, they are retrieved from storage, and the process ends with the parts being retrieved from storage.

If the parts are not in stock, the requirements are specified and quantified.

Following this, a purchase order is completed.

The purchase order is then checked by central purchasing.

If the vendor is known, an order template is created from the purchase order.

If the vendor is not known, a new vendor is created.

After the order template is created, the purchase order is approvedby the approver.

Following approval, the receipt of goods takes place by central purchasing and the process ends with the parts being procured.

In the event of an escalation with delivery problems during the receipt of goods, the order status is adjusted and the process will end with the order being cancelled due to delivery issues.
