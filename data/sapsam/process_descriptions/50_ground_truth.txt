The process begins with the initiation of a new marketing campaign at SoKnow.

The management starts by planning the focal points.

Next, the marketing department designs ideas and defines the specifications.

Once the specifications are set, an order is sent to the external marketing agency, which is then commissioned.

The agency creates drafts and sends them back to the marketing department, which receives and evaluates the drafts.

The drafts are then put to a vote.

If the vote is negative, the external marketing agency is asked for new drafts, and the drafts are re-evaluated.

If the vote is positive, the management is informed.

The management re-evaluates the drafts.

If the management's evaluation is negative, the external marketing agency is also asked for new drafts, and the drafts are re-evaluated.

If the management's evaluation is positive, the management gives the marketing department the green light, the campaign is conducted, and the external marketing agency is commissioned for the execution.

After the campaign is conducted, the marketing campaign is marked as completed.
