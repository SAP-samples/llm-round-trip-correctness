The Hotel Evanstonian process begins when an order is received from a hotel guest by the room service manager.

The room service manager creates and forwards the order ticket.

Next, several tasks are carried out in parallel:
In the kitchen, meals are prepared, while the waiter prepares the cart and non-alcoholic beverages.
The sommelier checks if wine is desired.
If yes, the sommelier fetches the wine from the cellar.
Then, it is checked if other alcoholic beverages are desired.
If yes, the sommelier prepares these beverages.

All prepared items are then consolidated, and the waiter delivers the desired order to the hotel guest.

After delivery, it is checked if there are no other orders to process.

If this is the case, the waiter debits the customer's account.

Finally, the customer order is completed.
