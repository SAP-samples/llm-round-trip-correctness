The SoKnow process begins with the order intake in the development department.

Next, the knowledge management system is purchased.

Subsequently, adjustment requests from the customer company are received, and the development department makes the adjustments.

After completing the adjustments, a notification is sent to the customer company.

Then, a test group is searched for and tests are conducted.

The test results are evaluated.

If the results are negative, further adjustments are made and tested again.

If the results are positive, test group workshops are conducted.

After the workshops, employees are trained.

Then, the development department is informed about any adjustment requests from the customer company.

If there are adjustment requests, the adjustments are made.

If there are no adjustment requests or the adjustments have been made, the customer is informed that the product is finished.

Next, it is checked whether the adjustments are satisfactory.

If not, the process is repeated from the adjustment stage.

If yes, the knowledge management system is implemented, and the process ends with the completion of the order.
