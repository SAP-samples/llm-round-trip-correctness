The process begins with the definition of requirements by the purchasing team.

Next, the selection of licenses is determined.

Then, it is checked whether the system has been executed.

If yes, a license is purchased; otherwise, a test license is bought.

After purchasing the license or test license, framework contracts are agreed upon, and a license purchase agreement is created.

The system then provides the license purchase contract data, and simultaneously, the contract information is updated.

Subsequently, an order is placed.

After the order is placed, the final acceptance of delivery occurs, followed by the review of framework agreements and the updating of the system.
Thus, the license is purchased.

In parallel, the payment is forwarded, and a message is sent to the Accounting/Controlling department to execute the payment.

The process ends with the confirmation that the license has been purchased and the payment has been executed.
