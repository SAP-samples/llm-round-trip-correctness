The process begins with a request to the support of the Hochschule Mainz to solve problems.

First, a ticket is received.

Once the ticket is received, it is determined whether the participation of the customer is necessary.

If customer participation is required, the customer is contacted, followed by a detailed interview on the problem.

After the interview, the support team connects to the client of the customer.

The customer and support then try to solve the problem together.

If further information is needed, the support asks for it and then tries to solve the problem again.

Once all necessary information is gathered, the problem is solved, and notes are created for documentation.

Finally, a confirmation that the ticket is completed is sent, and the process ends with the problem being solved.

If customer participation is not necessary, the support team proceeds to solve the problem without involving the customer.

After solving the problem, the support team creates notes for documentation and sends a confirmation that the ticket is completed.

The process concludes with the problem being solved.
