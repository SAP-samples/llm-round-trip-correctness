The SoKnow process begins with the HR department organizing employee interviews.

First, appointment suggestions are sent.

Then, the process branches: on one side, the employee interview is conducted, during which training is assigned, and on the other side, regular inquiries are made to ensure progress.

Simultaneously, the employee must confirm the appointment, participate in the interview, and complete the training.

Finally, the training is completed, and the employee interview is marked as conducted.
