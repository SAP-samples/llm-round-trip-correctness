The SoKnow process begins with securing the personnel development needs by the HR department.

Next, employee data is analyzed.

Subsequently, personnel capacity is checked, capacity requirements are determined, and training opportunities are identified.

These three tasks are performed in parallel.

After checking personnel capacity, determining capacity requirements, and identifying training opportunities, an employee interview is conducted.

Following the employee interview, the training request and improvement suggestions are considered, and training is allocated in parallel.

Once the training request is considered, improvement suggestions are considered, and training is allocated, these are discussed with the department head.

Then, the training/continuing education is organized.

Finally, the competency profile is updated, and the personnel development needs are secured.
