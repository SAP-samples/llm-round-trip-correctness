The process starts when an application is received by the recruitment department of ADOmoney Bank.

First, the application documents are reviewed, and a preselection is conducted.

Either a rejection is created after the preselection and sent to the applicant, ending the process with the applicant being rejected after the preselection, or the application documents are examined in detail.

Then, it is checked whether the application is for a key position.

If yes, a telephone interview is conducted, and subsequently, an appointment for a personal interview is communicated via email.

If no, an appointment for a personal interview is directly communicated via email.

The appointment for a personal interview is communicated via email until a suitable date is found.

Once a suitable date is found, the appointment and the applicant's documents are forwarded to the relevant department.

After that, the personal interview is conducted, and it is decided whether the applicant is suitable for the assessment center.

If yes, an appointment with the applicant for the assessment center is scheduled, and the assessment center is planned and prepared in parallel.

Once an appointment is scheduled and the assessment center is prepared, the assessment center is conducted, and a vote on the applicant is taken.

If the applicant is not suitable for the assessment center, a vote on the applicant is taken directly.

If the applicant is accepted, an acceptance letter is drafted and sent to the applicant.

If the applicant is rejected after the assessment center, a rejection letter is drafted and sent to the applicant.
