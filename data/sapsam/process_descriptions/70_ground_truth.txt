The process begins with the recording of a customer application in the service department.

Next, the order is recorded.

Then, the customer data is checked by the finance department.

If the data is correct, the order is released and communicated to the service department.

Otherwise, the order is rejected and the customer is informed by the service department.

After the order is released, it is received and further processed by the service department.

The processed order is then printed and subsequently forwarded.

The process ends either with informing the customer or forwarding the customer order.
