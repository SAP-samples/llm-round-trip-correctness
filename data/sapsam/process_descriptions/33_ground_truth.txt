The SoKnow process begins with an employee analyzing technology needs.


Next, a market analysis is conducted by the employee and, in parallel, developers generate ideas.

After the ideas are found, they are reviewed by the employees.

Following the review of the ideas and the completion of the market analysis, the idea is passed to project management.

Project management then decides whether to approve the idea or not.

If the idea is not approved, it is rejected.

If the idea is approved, this is noted and the process continues.

The process ends with the discovery of new technologies.
