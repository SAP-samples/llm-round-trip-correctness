The learning progress process begins with the start event.

Teachers activate the learning progress in selected objects.

Students click on "Learning Progress" for each object.

After students click on "Learning Progress" for each object, a decision is made whether the learning progress is set manually by the user or automatically by the teacher.

If the learning progress is set manually, it is done by the user.

If it is set automatically, it is done by the teacher.

After students click on "Learning Progress" for each object or teachers activate the learning progress in selected objects, the status of the learning progress is displayed through color markings.

There are different possibilities:
A red cross means that the course, test, or exercise was not passed.
A green marking indicates that the task was fully processed.
A yellow marking means that the task is in progress.
A gray marking shows that the task has not yet started.

The process then ends.
