The purchasing process begins with the customer selecting and buying goods online.

Next, the finance department checks if a creditworthiness check is required.

If a credit check is needed, the necessary information is requested, and the creditworthiness is assessed.

If the customer is deemed creditworthy, the warehouse is informed about the shipping.

If the customer is not deemed creditworthy, they are informed about the rejection, and the process ends.

If no credit check is required or the customer is deemed creditworthy, the warehouse is informed about the shipping and checks if the item is available in stock.

If the item is not available, a reorder is triggered, and the availability is checked again until the item is in stock.

If the item is available, it is packed and shipped, and the customer receives the purchase and shipping confirmation.

The process then ends.
