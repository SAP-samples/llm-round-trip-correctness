The online selling process of the eBay data stores is started.

First, the seller is displaying items on the webpage.

The buyer can the purchase the item.

After the purchase, the seller receives the buyer's order and sends an order purchase confirmation to the buyer.

Following this, the seller sends the order to the shipping company.

The shipping company then gets the item and decides on what it will do.

If the shipping company delivers the item to the customer in proper datess, eBay tracks the order, and the process concludes with the buyer closing the order.

However, if the shipping company does not deliver the purchase, the buyer has to decide what to do: ask for a money reimbursement or request a reshipment of the item.

If the buyer asks for a money reimbursement, the seller receives the buyer's decision and reimburses the money and the process ends with an escalation event.

If the buyer requests a reshipment of the item, the process continues with the seller sending the order to the shipping company again.
