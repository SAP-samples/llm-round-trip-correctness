The library process begins when the student enters the library.

First, the student goes to the PC to search for books.

After some time has passed, the student searches for books and goes to the checkout counter.

There, the library staff checks the student's ID.

It is verified whether the ID is valid.

If the ID is valid, the student receives the books and leaves the library.

If the ID is not valid, the student does not receive the books and leaves the library as well.
