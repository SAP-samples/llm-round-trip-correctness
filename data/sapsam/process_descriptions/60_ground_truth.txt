The process begins with the introduction of change processes in SoKnow's consulting.
Next, new strategies and opportunities are received through consulting services.
These new strategies are then communicated.
Following this, suitable systems are selected, implemented, and also communicated.
In the next step, the change processes are coordinated within the project.
Finally, working groups consult about the change processes.
The process ends when the change process is introduced.
