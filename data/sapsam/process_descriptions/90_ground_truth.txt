The process in the strategy process at SoKonow begins with claiming the revenue.

Next, a decision is made whether to ensure self-financing or to receive funding amounts.

If self-financing is ensured, the process moves to the next decision.

If funding amounts are received, the process also moves to the next decision.

Subsequently, work is done in parallel to gain a high market share in open-source solutions and to generate revenue through additional services.

Once these tasks are completed, training units are organized and consulting services are performed in parallel.

After the consulting services are performed, follow-up projects are generated.

The process ends when the revenue has been claimed.
