The process of the wow community begins with the initiation of the WoW subscription by the online tool for creating characters.

The first step involves sending the subscription form.

Once the form is sent, the applicant from the wow community selects the payment method.

If the applicant chooses to pay by credit card, they proceed to enter their credit card information.

If the applicant opts for a bank account, they enter their IBAN and BIC numbers.

After entering either payment details, the applicant submits the information.

Following the submission, the online tool for creating characters actives the WoW subscription.

Finally, the process concludes with the end of the WoW subscription.
