The process in Accounting and Controlling begins with creating the booking system.

Next, the booking system is started and the payment is read.

Then, the payment automation is initiated.

A decision follows on whether the payment has been made.

If the payment has been made, the payment is booked and the process ends with the confirmation that the payment has been made.

If the payment has not been made, a reminder is sent.

After that, it is checked whether the payment has been made after the reminder.

If the payment has been made after the reminder, the payment is booked and the process ends with the confirmation that the payment has been made.

If the payment has not been made after the reminder, a written dunning procedure is initiated.

Then, the reminder notice is reviewed.

If the review is successful, the reminder notice is sent and the process ends with the confirmation that the reminder notice has been sent.

If the review is not successful, the reminder notice is correctly filled out and reviewed again.

The process repeats until the review is successful and the reminder notice is sent.
