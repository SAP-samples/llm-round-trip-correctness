The SoKnown process begins when a late payment is received in the finance department.

Subsequently, management is informed.

It is checked whether a reminder has already been sent.

If yes, an inquiry is made with the customer, and an inquiry email is sent to the customer company.

If a response is received, an online banking check is performed.

Once the check is completed, the payment is posted, and the process ends with the payment being processed.

If no response is received, a lawyer is notified, and a request for legal assistance is sent to an external lawyer.

Then, the reminder process is run (target process), and the process ends with the payment being processed.

If no reminder has been sent, a reminder is created by the legal department and sent to the customer company.

It is checked whether the payment has been made.

If yes, the reminder process is completed, and the payment is posted as described earlier, ending with the payment being processed.

If no, another reminder is created.

If the third reminder is unsuccessful, the finance department is notified, and the lawyer is also notified as described above.
