A customer wants a loan and begins by filling out the credit application.

Once the credit application is completed, it is sent to the mediation agency.

The mediation agency receives the application and forwards it to Bank A and Bank B, where respective loan requests are received.

Bank B checks the loan amount and decides if the customer's income is between €2,000 and €100,000.
If the income is not within this range, a rejection is sent.
If the income is within the specified range, it is checked whether the loan amount is greater than 20 times the monthly income.
If this is the case, a rejection is sent to the mediation agency.
Otherwise, the interest rate determination is carried out and a credit report is sent to the mediation agency.

In parallel, Bank A also receives a loan request and checks the loan amount.
If the loan amount is greater than 20 times the monthly income, a rejection is sent to the mediation agency.
Otherwise, 20% interest per year is estimated and a credit report is sent to the mediation agency.

The mediation agency receives the rejection or credit reports from both banks and forwards them to the customer.

The customer can either receive a rejection or a credit proposal.

In both cases, the loan process is completed.
