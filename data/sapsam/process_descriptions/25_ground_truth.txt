The process begins when the credit institution is informed that the SEC approval process has started.

Next, the registration report is prepared and the check against Blue-Sky laws is conducted in parallel.

Once both tasks are completed, the preparation for determining the issue price and the wait for the company's registration approval occur simultaneously.
After the issue price preparation, an information event is organized.

Once the registration approval is received and the information event is organized, the issue price is decided.

Then, it is checked whether the obligation really occurs.

If the obligation occurs, the contract is concluded and the stock is offered to the public.

If the obligation does not occur, the process is aborted.
