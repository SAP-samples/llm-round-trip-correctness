The process of clerks begins when a patient registers at the hospital.

The clerk starts by recording the data of each patient.

Once the data is recorded, the patient's SSN is registered, the patient's name is registered and the patient's surname is registered. These tasks are performed simultaneously.

After these registrations are completed, the process converges, and the clerk proceeds to print the referral document.

Following the printing, the record is archived in the file system.

Finally, the registration process is completed, marking the end of the procedure.
