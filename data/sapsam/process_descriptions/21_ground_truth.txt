The process at MyMuffin begins with the receipt of a new order.

Once the order is received, the phase 1 tasks in MyMuffin commence simultaneously.

These tasks include preparing the dough, setting up the delivery, and preparing the cooking paper.

After these phase 1 tasks are completed, the process moves to phase 2, where the muffins are prepared.

Following the preparation of the muffins, they are cooked.

Once the muffins are cooked, the process advances to phase 3, where the requirements for this phase are met.

This includes initiating the payment process and dispatching the muffins.

Once the payment is completed and the muffins are dispatched, phase 3 is ended, marking the end of the process.
