The process begins with the event that the customer is hungry.

Then, the customer chooses a pizza from the menu.

After making the choice, the customer orders the pizza by phone.

At this point, there are two possible scenarios: either the customer waits 60 minutes, or they call the pizzeria to inquire about the status of the order.

If the customer has waited 60 minutes, the pizza may have arrived, or the customer may need to call the pizzeria again to inquire.

Once the pizza has arrived, the customer pays the delivery boy.

After that, the customer eats the pizza and the hunger is satisfied.
