The process begins with the customer placing an order for menus.
Once the order is placed, the customer confirms the order.
The confirmed order is then received by the delivery team, who proceed to the shop to collect the items.
The delivery team then takes the food order for delivery or the vegetable order for delivery, depending on the type of order.
If it is a food order, the delivery team takes the order to the restaurant, where the restaurant receives the food order and begins cooking.
After cooking, the food is prepared and collected by the delivery team.
If it is a vegetable order, the delivery team takes the order to the farmer, who receives the vegetable order and prepares it.
The prepared vegetable order is then collected by the delivery team.

Once the order is collected, the delivery team delivers it to the customer.
Upon delivery, the customer proceeds to make the payment.
The customer can choose to pay by credit card, cash, or PayPal.
If the customer chooses to pay by credit card, the payment is processed, and the order and payment are recorded.
If the customer chooses to pay by cash, the payment is processed, and the order and payment are recorded.
If the customer chooses to pay by PayPal, the payment is processed, and the order and payment are recorded.
After the payment is completed, the customer receives the order, and the process ends.
