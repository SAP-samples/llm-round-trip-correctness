The process in the procurement department of ACME AG starts as soon as a need arises.

The first step is to check the stock to see if the required work equipment is available.

If the work equipment is in stock, it is retrieved from the storeroom, and the process ends with the work equipment being removed from the storeroom.

If the work equipment is not in stock, the requirements are specified and quantified.

Following this, an order is placed.

The process then waits 5 days for the receipt of the work equipment from the supplier. 

If the the receipt of the work equipment is received before the 5 days pass, the process end with the work equipment being procured.

If the receipt for the work equipment is not received after 5 days, the order is placed by e-mail to the supplier.

The process continues upon the receipt of the work equipment.

Finally, the process ends with the work equipment being procured.
