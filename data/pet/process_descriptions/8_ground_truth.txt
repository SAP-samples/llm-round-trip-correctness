The process begins.

Following this, a BKR check and a Jane Doe check are performed simultaneously by the risk management.

Next, the credibility check is confirmed.

Once these checks are completed, the senior risk management confirms the credibility check.

If the assessment is rejected, a rejection letter is sent to the client by the administration, and the process ends.

If the assessment is accepted, the client is called by the customer contact to complement information.

If the call was not picked up, the client is called again after one hour. This repeats until the client picks up.

If the call was picked up, a loan offer is created and sent to the client.

In case two hours pass, the client is reminded, until finance receives the accepted offer.

Upon receiving the accepted offer, a welcome letter is sent by the administration, and the loan application is activated by finance.

The activation is then validated and the initial payment is executed.

After the initial payment, the documents are returned to the client by the administration, and the process concludes.
