The process begins with the client initiating a new service.

The client enters the store and looks for a specific service.

If the client does not find the service, the process ends.

If the client finds the service, the client takes a ticket representing their turn.
 
Next it is checked were the ticket was taken.

If the ticket was taken in der app, the client waits for the waiting time, looks for the product and specific criteria and checks how many tickets are ahead until it is his/her turn.

If the ticket was taken physically, the client just waits for his/her turn.

Once it is their turn, the client asks for a specific request, which is communicated to the request assistant.

After the register time expired and the request is communicated to the request assistant, the request assistant registers the request and checks if there are enough requests to respond to customer demand.

If there are not enough requests, the request assistant continues to register requests and checks again until there are enough requests to respond to customer demand.

If there are enough requests, the request assistant sends the order request document to the shop assistants' team, who then prepare the order and the registering is over.

Once the order is prepared and the order description is received, the shop assistants' team delivers the order to the client, who then collects their order.

Preperation of the shop assistants team is finishedafter the order is delivered.

The process ends when the client collects their order and the process is marked as ended.
