The text below is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. When confirming the basic information is completed, confirming if the process requires optimization needs to be done. After confirming if the process requires optimization, one or more of the following paths should be executed: noting which steps can be automated, looking to see if the process can be simplified. When noting which steps can be automated is completed, defining how long it takes to complete the process needs to be done. When looking to see if the process can be simplified is completed, examining potentially wasteful steps should be done. After that, you need to write the potential process improvements. After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: defining what would make the improvements successful and using the updated process. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then implementing the process changes should be done. The process is now completed.
