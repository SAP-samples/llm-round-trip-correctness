The text below is about the accounts receivable process. It begins when you record the buyer's details. When recording the buyer's details is completed, the next tasks should be sending a credit application form to the buyer and running a credit check on the purchasing company, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be sending the invoice in your accounting software and checking customer payment terms, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: making a second physical copy and recording your activity digitally. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: recording the sales on credit of services, recording the sales on credit of goods. The process is now completed.
