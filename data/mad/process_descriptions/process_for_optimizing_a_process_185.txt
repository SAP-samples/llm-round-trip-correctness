The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It begins when you confirm the basic information. After confirming the basic information, the next tasks should be identifying the process's components and assessing the performance of the process, they should be done in parallel. Once assessing the performance of the process occurs, you need to confirm if the process requires optimization. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to define how long it takes to complete the process. When defining how long it takes to complete the process is completed, writing the potential process improvements needs to be done. Once writing the potential process improvements occurs, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. Once getting approval for processing improvements occurs, the next tasks should be using the updated process and defining what would make the improvements successful, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: communicating the process changes and scheduling the next process review and optimization. Once communicating the process changes occurs, you need to implement the process changes. The process is now completed.
