The text below is about the loan application process. It starts with providing the bank statement to the lender. After providing the bank statement to the lender, you need to complete the loan application by borrower. After completing the loan application by borrower, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: giving the written notice to applicant and sending application back to the applicant. Once sending application back to the applicant occurs, checking for the completeness should be taken into account. if all is complete, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should check for the completeness. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be reducing loan amount and changing the interest rate, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to receive the loans fund. The process is now completed.
