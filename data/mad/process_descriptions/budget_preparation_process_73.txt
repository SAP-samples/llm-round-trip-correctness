The following text is about the budget preparation process. It begins when you record basic details. Once recording basic details occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: evaluating any significant variances and reviewing the most recent budget. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to prioritize three to five goals. Once prioritizing three to five goals occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: estimating the average monthly cost, calculating the total annual budget. After that, you need to list all sources of income. Once listing all sources of income occurs, the next tasks should be finalizing the budget and recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be assigning management responsibilities and requesting approval from top management, they should be done in parallel. The process is now completed.
