The text below is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It begins when you check the ticket type. After checking the ticket type, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ticket type as 'Marketing/PR Question', determining ticket type as 'Technical Issue'. When determining ticket type as 'Marketing/PR Question' is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: determining ticket type as 'Feature Request', determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question'. After determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question', the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'App Question' and determining ticket type as 'Mixed-type question'. Then, the next tasks should be replicating the issue, responsing ticket question and testing technical issues, they should be done in parallel. The process is now completed.
