The following text is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. After confirming the basic information, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assessing the performance of the process and identifying the process's components. Once identifying the process's components occurs, confirming if the process requires optimization needs to be done. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assessing if any steps are confusing and noting which steps can be automated. Once noting which steps can be automated occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: defining how long it takes to complete the process and examining potentially wasteful steps. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to write the potential process improvements. When writing the potential process improvements is completed, getting approval for processing improvements needs to be done. When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: using the updated process and determining what improvements should go forward. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be communicating the process changes and scheduling the next process review and optimization, they should be done in parallel. The process is now completed.
