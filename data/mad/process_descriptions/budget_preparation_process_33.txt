The text below is about the budget preparation process. It starts with setting target date for approval. Once setting target date for approval occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing the most recent budget and evaluating any significant variances. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then determining ways of achieving the goals needs to be done. After determining ways of achieving the goals, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: calculating the total annual budget and estimating the average monthly cost. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then projecting total annual income needs to be done. After projecting total annual income, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording financial data in a budget spreadsheet and finalizing the budget. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: requesting approval from top management, assigning management responsibilities. Once assigning management responsibilities occurs, the next tasks should be obtaining approval from top management and incorporating into the master budget, they should be done in parallel. The process is now completed.
