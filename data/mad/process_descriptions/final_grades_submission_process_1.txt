The text below is about the final grades submission process. It starts with unmuting all gradebook columns. When unmuting all gradebook columns is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: importing gradebook and calculating the grades. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: reviewing grades summary and reviewing course summary. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to export the final grades. After exporting the final grades, one or more of the following paths should be executed: getting approval signatures by the course director, submitting results to SSO. The process is now completed.
