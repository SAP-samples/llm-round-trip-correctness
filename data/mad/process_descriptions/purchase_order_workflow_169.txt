When creating the purchase requisition is completed, the next tasks should be getting approval from finance team and getting approval from manager, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: informing the supplier the order is ready for approval and creating the purchase order. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then getting approval from supplier should be done. When getting approval from supplier is completed, one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending details to the department, confirming the delivery date, recording the purchase order. Once confirming the delivery date occurs, filing the purchase order should be done. The process is now completed.
