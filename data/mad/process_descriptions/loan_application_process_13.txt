The following description is about the loan application process. It begins when you provide the previous loan statement to the lender. Once providing the previous loan statement to the lender occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: completing the loan application by borrower and receiving the application by credit department. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: checking for the completeness and giving the written notice to applicant. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: beginning the underwriting process and checking the credit score and risk score. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then reducing loan amount needs to be done. Once reducing loan amount occurs, you need to receive the loans fund. The process is now completed.
