The following text is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. After making an introduction, discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor needs to be done. When discussing role, goals and projects with supervisor is completed, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assigning training material and taking out to lunch. Once taking out to lunch occurs, the next tasks should be holding a welcoming ceremony, explaining your expectations and touring the office, they should be done in parallel. When holding a welcoming ceremony is completed, you need to assign a mentor. When explaining your expectations is completed, inducting into company culture needs to be done. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then assigning first project should be done. When assigning first project is completed, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: planning check-in meetings, explaining long-term goals and providing reading material for personal growth. Once planning check-in meetings occurs, encouraging them to socially interact with the team needs to be done. Once providing reading material for personal growth occurs, you need to review onboarding process over the next 60 days. The process is now completed.
