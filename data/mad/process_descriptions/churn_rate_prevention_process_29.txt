The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. After recording basic details, identifying key points of value needs to be done. When identifying key points of value is completed, you need to give them a call. When giving them a call is completed, you need to identify the root cause(s) of the problem. Once identifying the root cause(s) of the problem occurs, informing them of key metrics demonstrating value needs to be done. After informing them of key metrics demonstrating value, recording the customer’s decision should be done. After recording the customer’s decision, you need to ask if they have any other concerns. Once asking if they have any other concerns occurs, sending learnings to appropriate managers should be done. The process is now completed.
