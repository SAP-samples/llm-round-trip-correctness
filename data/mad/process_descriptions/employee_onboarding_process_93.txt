The text below is about the employee onboarding process. It begins when you make an introduction. Once making an introduction occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: creating accounts and getting approval. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 3 parallel branches: touring the office, holding a welcoming ceremony and assigning a mentor. Once assigning a mentor occurs, the next tasks should be explaining your expectations, inducting into company culture and assigning training material, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: getting approval and checking the paperwork. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: explaining long-term goals, reviewing onboarding process over the next 60 days, encouraging them to socially interact with the team. The process is now completed.
