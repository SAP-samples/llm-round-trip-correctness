The following description is about the customer support process for the ticket management. It starts with checking the ticket type. After checking the ticket type, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: determining ticket type as 'Sales Question' and determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question'. Once determining ticket type as 'I'm not sure question' occurs, determining ticket type as 'Billing Question' should be done. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then replicating the issue should be taken into account. if all could replicate, then nothing needs to be done, otherwise you should replicate the issue. The process is now completed.
