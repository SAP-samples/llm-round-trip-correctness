The following description is about the churn rate prevention process. It begins when you record basic details. After recording basic details, identifying key points of value should be done. Once identifying key points of value occurs, one or more of the following paths should be executed: sending them an email, confirming call date and time, recording if they are willing to talk. After sending them an email, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: recording whether or not the customer responded and giving them a call. After that, the next tasks should be asking open-ended questions, summarizing why they want to leave and identifying the root cause(s) of the problem, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the next tasks should be informing them of key metrics demonstrating value and presenting them with a special offer, they should be done in parallel. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then the process is split into 2 parallel branches: thanking them for their time and feedback and recording the customerâ€™s decision. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then asking if they have any other concerns should be done. When asking if they have any other concerns is completed, you need to send learnings to appropriate managers. The process is now completed.
