The following description is about the process for optimizing a process. It starts with confirming the basic information. Once confirming the basic information occurs, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: assessing the performance of the process and identifying the process's components. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then one or more of the following paths should be executed: noting which steps can be automated, assessing if any steps are confusing. After assessing if any steps are confusing, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: defining how long it takes to complete the process and looking to see if the process can be simplified. After looking to see if the process can be simplified, one or more of the following paths should be executed: considering where bottlenecks occur, examining potentially wasteful steps. Afterwards, writing the potential process improvements needs to be done. After writing the potential process improvements, getting approval for processing improvements should be done. When getting approval for processing improvements is completed, updating the process documents should be done. When updating the process documents is completed, communicating the process changes needs to be done. The process is now completed.
