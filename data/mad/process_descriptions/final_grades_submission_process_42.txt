The text below is about the final grades submission process. It begins when you ensure 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need. After ensuring 'EX' or zero marks are applied as need, one or more of the following paths should be executed: preparing grades for SSO, applying special grades to individuals, calculating the grades. When calculating the grades is completed, you need to select exam assignment. Then, the process is split into 3 parallel branches: applying any changes, reviewing course summary and reviewing grades summary. Once all pre-tasks are executed, then you need to export the final grades. After exporting the final grades, sending examiners grade approval sheet should be done. The process is now completed.
