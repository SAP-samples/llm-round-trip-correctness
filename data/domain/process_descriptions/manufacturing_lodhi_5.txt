First, a task with the id a5 and the label "Receive production order" occurs. Then a task with the id a16 and the label "Prepare production order" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a6 and the label "Collect raw materials" occurs. Then a task with the id a7 and the label "Cutting" occurs. Then a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1, occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a9 and the label "Stitching". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a10 and the label "Printing". Finally the branches of PG1 are joined. Then a task with the id a12 and the label "Complete production" occurs. Then a task with the id a0 and the label "Check quality" occurs. Then a task with the id a1 and the label "Create quality report" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a3 and the label "Adjust  settings". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a13 and the label "Send data to warehouse". At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
