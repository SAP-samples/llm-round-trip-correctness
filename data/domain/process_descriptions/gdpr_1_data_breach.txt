First, a task with the id a0 and the label "Retrieve breached data" occurs. Then a task with the id a1 and the label "Retrieve breached subjects" occurs. It is called with the following parameters:  is "". Then a parallel gateway with 2 branches, furthermore dubbed PG1, occurs. The first entry in in the first parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a7 and the label "Data loss limitation". The first entry in in the second parallel branch of PG1 is a task with the id a3 and the label "Notify national authority". It is called with the following parameters:  is "". Then a task with the id a8 and the label "Evaluate stolen data" occurs. It is called with the following parameters:  is "". Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs.

Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first entry in in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a13 and the label "Request if breached data has to be communicated to the data subject". Then a task with the id a17 and the label "Receive notification for the request" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D3. The only entry in the second branch of D3 is a task with the id a18 and the label "Send notification". Following this, all branches of D3 are finished. The only entry in the second branch of D2 is a task with the id a18 and the label "Send notification". Following this, all branches of D2 are finished. The only entry in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a18 and the label "Send notification". Following this, all branches of D1 are finished. Finally the branches of PG1 are joined, and the process ends.
