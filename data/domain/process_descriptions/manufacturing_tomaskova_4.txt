First, the start of a loop occurs. Then a task with the id a1 and the label "Production planning" occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Assign workers" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Production design" occurs. Then a task with the id a4 and the label "Product delivery" occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Production logout" occurs. Then a task with the id a6 and the label "Quality control" occurs. If we reach this point we loop back. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a11 and the label "Register to the finished stock". Then a task with the id a13 and the label "Stock to the finished goods" occurs. The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a10 and the label "Register to the semi-finished stock". Then a task with the id a12 and the label "Load to the semi-finished stock" occurs. Following this, all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
