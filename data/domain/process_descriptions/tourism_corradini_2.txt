First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Search for a customer" occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Make customer an offer" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a4 and the label "Receive additional request". Then a task with the id a6 and the label "Provide details" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The first entry in in the second branch of D2 is a task with the id a8 and the label "Receive booking request". Then a task with the id a11 and the label "Send the bill" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a13 and the label "Receive payment" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D3. The only entry in the first branch of D3 is a task with the id a17 and the label "Contact customer". The first entry in in the second branch of D3 is a task with the id a10 and the label "Book travel". Then a task with the id a14 and the label "Send booking confirmation" occurs. At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all branches of D3 are finished. Following this, all branches of D2 are finished. Following this, all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
