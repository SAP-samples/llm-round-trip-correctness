First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Receive production order" occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Prepare materrials" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Assemble door" occurs. Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a5 and the label "Send inquiry for quality check" occurs. Then a task with the id a11 and the label "Receive inquiry for quality check" occurs. Then a task with the id a12 and the label "Check quality" occurs. Then a task with the id a13 and the label "Send quality report" occurs. Then a task with the id a6 and the label "Receive quality report" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The only entry in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a10 and the label "Fix door". The first entry in in the second branch of D1 is a task with the id a8 and the label "Release door". At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
