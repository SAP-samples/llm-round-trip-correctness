First, a task with the id a1 and the label "Get travel request" occurs. Then a task with the id a2 and the label "Prepare the tour plan" occurs. Then a task with the id a3 and the label "Send the tour  plan" occurs. Then a task with the id a4 and the label "Receive response" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D1. The first entry in in the first branch of D1 is a task with the id a7 and the label "Book the tour". Then an infinite loop (no condidition) occurs. Then a task with the id a6 and the label "Charge  customer" occurs. Then an exclusive decision with 2 branches occurs. This decision will be furthermore refered to as D2. The only entry in the first branch of D2 is a task with the id a9 and the label "Contact customer". The first entry in in the second branch of D2 is a task with the id a13 and the label "Send the bill". Then a task with the id a11 and the label "Send booking confirmation" occurs. At this point the innermost loop is exited. Following this, all branches of D2 are finished. Following this, all branches of D1 are finished, and the process ends.
